"The Curious Case of our Elephants","2025-04-22",1745311317,"The Curious Case of our Elephants","I spent some time at the Maryland Zoo today with some friends from out of state, and boy was it... something.

We had a good time, generally speaking, but something that upset all three of us was seeing ONE elephant in the Elephant enclosure. It wasn't that there was only one present, it was that this elephant in particular was exhibiting signs of zoochosis.

Ol buddy was standing in one spot, rocking it's  head side to side and swiping it's back right foot against the ground.

I'm not a zoologist, nor am I an expert in any way, but I've read enough about zoochosis to know what it can present like, and this poor elephant showed me and everyone else there that it wasn't doing well mentally.

Is there nothing we can do? That was some of the most depressing shit I've ever seen, and I hate that kids are going to see that and think it's ""just playing.""

Side bar: I do this with my paystubs as well and THAT works...because, my taxes are straight forward and the rates stay the same.

BGE cents/kWh changes over different months with no cause. Some months my bill's was $100s lower until BGE's added their delivery and service fees. Based on rates- please lets not forget - THEY MAKE UP.

So IF we are making our way to class action law suit. Why not add some pressure and all collectively NOT PAY these crooks? 

Has this been done before? An organized boycott where all at once a massive customer base refuses to pay the extortionist prices? Then we demand rate charts/transparent pricing and refunds.

Everyone else on the block is using one single trash bin. I even got some other neighbors on the north corner, who were leaving open trash outside of their apartment buildings trash bins, to get it together by returning their trash to their door and leaving a note. 

What can I do? Its incredibly sad to see someone so careless about the amount of trash theyre consuming. #EarthDay But also incredibly disgusting. The entire street typically avoids these people but they got a mouth full from me yesterday for parking in the middle of our street.

We're looking for interactive toys that make sounds, have pieces that the toddler can pull apart/shake, and that look interesting (colorful). Think Montessori toys or kitchen play sets. We're not really looking for puzzles or dolls. We'd also like to give a play mat to each family.

I would also appreciate suggestions for places to buy diapers and baby supplies locally.

Looking at housing prices on real estate sites, it looks insanely cheap. Obviously, a lot of these cheap houses are in neighborhoods that people tend to avoid, due to crime and the like. But even in more desirable neighborhoods, it looks much cheaper than what I've seen in most other cities. And as someone who appreciates density and walkability, I really like the rowhouses that are all over the city. Is there something else I'm missing about them, like astronomical property tax?

What is the social scene in Baltimore like? Is it easy for transplants to make friends in the city? And what is dating like for a white-passing guy in his 20s?

What is the job market in Baltimore like right now? I know Maryland has a lot of federal workers and DOGE is wreaking havoc on the federal workforce right now, but is Baltimore as affected as the D.C. suburbs for instance? Like, would it be difficult for me to find employment in the city? (For reference I am an Electrical Engineer)

Any general tips on when &amp; where for looking for places in the area would be super appreciated :)","baltimore",15,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1k2wrpp/moving_in_june/"

Id love for her to get a second opinion from a urologist who is very capable and also has a good bedside manner with a senior who is not good with tech.

*Flanked by a cadre of cops and city officials, Mayor Brandon Scott on Wednesday announced the takedown of a drug trafficking organization in Curtis Bay  yet the aftermath of these coveted busts can be deadly for drug users.*

*The joint operation, conducted by law enforcement agencies at every level of government, yielded 11 arrests and was touted as a valiant effort under the city's*Â [*Group Violence Reduction Strategy*](https://monse.baltimorecity.gov/gvrs-new?ref=mobtownredux.news)Â *during a press conference at the Curtis Bay Recreation Center. Officials made it clear that drug dealing and the violence it's associated with have no place in Baltimore, issuing a stern warning to those who continue despite offers to divert them from the lifestyle.*

*However, contrary to the celebratory nature of such announcements in Baltimore and elsewhere in the nation, the repercussions of police operations targeting those who sell drugs can be a death sentence for those who use them.*

*The cops may remove the drugs from the streets, but they're replaced as quickly as they were seized. After busts, drug users respond to the disruption in the drug supply by taking their business elsewhere. Studies have shown they're often met with deadlier dope.*","baltimore",32,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1jxh9mb/baltimore_officials_love_a_good_drug_bust_but/"

Superrr shady business practices at The Ivy Hotel/ Magdalena","Hey everyone, I'm looking to file a lawsuit against Magdalena/ The Ivy for a few labor law violations when I worked for them last winter. I've never done this so im so unsure of what to do!!

1. The restaurant director hired me as server support but never had me fill out any tax forms or clock in to record my hours. All of our correspondences are recorded over email. I was advised by my coworker to log my own hours and they'd back pay me after orientation, which I showed up for and they canceled on me and never rescheduled.

2. I did well and worked there for 4 weeks until I was ghosted after I called out a few hours before a shift. A week went by with no further contact and no mention of my pay until I emailed the director about it. He promised to pay but another 2 weeks passed and I emailed him again to which he responded saying that my check was sitting, waiting for me the entire time.

3. In the last emails, I directly asked about the status of my employment and the director told me where to find my check and thanked me for my work. I replied directly asking him again and he simply said that they wouldn't be moving forward with me and wouldn't give a reason why. It seems very illegal for him to not tell me that I was fired for 2 weeks and fail to give me a reason. HOWEVER when I went to retrieve the check I asked my former coworker and they mentioned that he told the staff that I did a no call no show even tho I gave notice and explanation about why I couldn't attend my shift and he acknowledged my email when I called out!! 

4. I'm sure he also paid me the wrong amount bc he never asked for the hours that I was keeping track of so he just made up the numbers. I asked if he could send me the breakdown, he emailed saying that he would but has never contacted me again LOL 

I was basically a glorified helper bc he'd always email me less than 3 days before he wanted me to work and expected me to work 8+ hours both Fri and Sat evenings. Does this sound solid to you guys? I also read that others have had shit experiences with them too :/ ","baltimore",13,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1k7vkfe/recommendations_for_labor_lawyers_superrr_shady/"

I'm currently in a edmondson village rowhome in a month to month and my room is relatively peaceful but even here on the edge of bmore theres a lot of mowers, road noise, the hvac is kinda loud, and the landlord isnt really understanding of how bad severe pain hyperacusis can be and does stuff like leave what sounds like an industrial fan in his locked room overnight you can hear throughout the whole house, i couldnt sleep last night. Im also really chemically sensitive and allergic to vinyl, so I do a lot better in hardwood/carpet homes that have offgassed all their crap but are well cleaned. Due to disability and only a limited ability to work from home my income is like 1250 plus some food benefits, so my realistic budget to rent a room is like 600-800 even stretching immensely. I was originally in Pasadena and would have preferred a more rural/suburb area to be honest, but it feels like only in baltimore can you really find much in that budget range. But is it impossible to find a room for rent in bmore that stays very quiet?

- Will I face issues parking behind my rowhome on the grass? 
- How can I check if a rowhome will qualify for parking pad while still considering making an offer? Would the planning department support or is this an out of pocket cost for a survey during contracts?
- Have people run into any issues with installing parking for historic properties?

"Dumping issue","2025-04-07",1744033553,"Dumping issue","Hi all, I have a specific issue with dumping that I was wondering if anyone else has experienced. 

Behind our block is an alleyway with a T intersection (2 alleyways meet right behind my house), and the main alley that runs parallel to our block is recognized as a public alley by the city and is kept relatively clear by the neighborhood. However, the perpendicular alley is directly across from our backyard and is a major dumping area and has been for years. 

I tried to report it to 311 but they informed me that it is private property, which is weird because its obviously an alleyway that goes behind several houses and a garage. 
The residents of the houses and the garage owner dont seem to care, and basically we are the only house that has a clear view of the junk every day.  

I would try to clean it myself but its a lot of junk and I feel like I shouldnt clean up what is behind other peoples houses. I was thinking of reaching out to my council person about it, but thought Id come here first to see if anyone has any solutions I havent thought about.

I am training for a triathlon that is in July. I just moved to Baltimore from Annapolis about a month ago and I am unfamiliar with swim centers that may be in the Baltimore / Towson area.

I do work for UMMC and see that they have options for membership as well at RecWell, has anyone had experience with this?

Im really hoping someone here can offer some advice or *sympathy* regarding an ongoing issue with my upstairs neighbor. The situation has become unbearable, and Im at my wits end.

For weeks now, Ive been dealing with constant noise from above**loud banging, stomping, dropping objects, etc. Its gotten so bad that its affecting my sleep and overall well-being**. Ive tried communicating directly with the neighbor to ask them to keep it down, but unfortunately, that has done nothing to resolve the problem. Im starting to feel like Im being ignored, and the situation is only getting worse.

At this point, weve reached a point where weve started banging on their floor through our ceiling in an attempt to get them to stop. I know this probably makes things worse, but were just so fed up. Im wondering if anyone has been through something similar and can offer advice on how to handle this before it escalates further. **Should I go back to my landlord? Are there any legal avenues I can pursue?**

Ive already documented the noise disturbances, and Im trying to stay calm, but the **stress** is getting to be a lot. Any thoughts would be appreciated!

Does anyone use any of these approaches to get to MARC?  How are they?  Taking those two overpasses seem somewhat sketchy but I don't know what traffic volume across them is like.  The skywalk seems safe, but that's a slow dismounted walk.

Eyeballing seems to indicate Conway St. would be a straight shot, but by the looks of it I assume that would be a hazardous route to take.  Pratt's going the wrong way, and I don't know that Lombard would be bikeable much at all.

Vernon/Remington/Inner Harbor area","What the text said: last night (around 10pm), someone stole my wallet, did a transaction (that ended up being alerted onto my phone), and then denied it when I confronted her (even though there was both a charge to my account that match her movements, as she used my card to get a big dinner for herself, as well as the CCTV footage from the original restaurant - Never On Sundays). Judging by the places that she tried to use my card (a restaurant nearby Never On Sundays *before I lock my card*, 7-11, and then Lyft rides), I think the wallet (either still with the thief, or is already thrown) would be in the Remington/Mt.Vernon/Inner Harbor area (last attempted charge was for a Lyft ride at around 6:30pm today). The card is also locked already, .

The wallet is seafoam green (light, bluish green) with golden zippers and a Fossil logo at the front. Inside should have library cards, my student ID, my employment authorization card, a Vietnamese passport (which is also mine) and my Social Security card. 

The person who took my wallet wears a white hoodie, is Black, has her hair down straight, and has a silver bag with her. She also look around her 40s-60s. 

I have filed a report with the PD earlier today, if that is of help. Its already a lot with me prepping for my own graduation and whatnot, and now the person who took it has not displayed any willingness to return it, so I unfortunately would have to ask whoever saw my wallet with her to please call the police.

Please PM me if it turns out you found it somewhere and it is safe!

"Trying to remember a guy who ran a coin shop in the 1970s","2025-04-03",1743672150,"Trying to remember a guy who ran a coin shop in the 1970s","**Backstory:**Â When I was a kid in the late 1970s, my dad regularly took me to a coin shop in Baltimore on what I'm thinking was Charles Street, but I'm not certain. I collected coins for several years, and Dad seemed to like taking me to this shop.

**What I remember:**Â The guy who ran the shop was a portly gentleman; to me as a kid he seemed very large. The shop was tiny. It had this case where I could press a button and trays of coins would rotate up and around. That was fun. I was mostly interested in whatever the guy recommended that (I assume) was in Dad's price range. Mostly Indian head cents, and a few interesting types here and there (a half-dime at some point, as I recall).

The proprietor seemed like a character (Dad loved characters). Once, my dad must have asked about the safety of the place, and the guy stood up and showed something like a .357 holstered on his hip. I'm no ballistics expert but it was big. He said something more or less like, ""Anyone tries to rob me, I'm gonna blow them right through that window into the street."" As a 9-year-old boy, that's not a statement you easily forget.

At some point, he either died or there was some kind of transfer of ownership and a different guy moved the shop out to Timonium. Not long after that, Dad died and I kind of lost interest in coin collecting. While I haven't actively collected since then, I've always loved coins. I ""visit"" my collection now and then, and I like reading about coins. Anyway, if anyone recalls who this guy was (I'm betting he's long gone now), or better yet, has any specific memories of him, I'd be delighted to hear about it!","baltimore",7,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1jqdusq/trying_to_remember_a_guy_who_ran_a_coin_shop_in/"

Thanks for all of the recommendations so far. We definitely love places with interesting, quirky vibes. We were going to go to the Paper Moon Diner but it looks like it closes early. 

We're open to any recommendations, but we probably won't have the time tonight for anything too upscale or involved. We're into most types of food, we love trying new things and also love standard bar food/comfort food, and depending on traffic we may need to just stop and grab something quick.

We'd probably prefer something walkable, but we'll be driving so if there's something really cool that you'd recommend elsewhere in the city, let me know.

***EDIT 4/18***
Thanks for the recommendations. We wound up hitting traffic and getting into Baltimore later than we'd hoped so we grabbed something quick at R. House.

MTA's website says that bikes are allowed on the entrances that either say ""bike entrance"" or have a green light.  However, I'm frequently seeing entrances with red lights that have a bunch of bikes inside them.  Do the conductors turn the lights red when the car reaches capacity, or are these people just breaking the rules and there is no enforcement?

It seems like this is particularly true when there are 8000 cars (where bikes must be bungeed to 4-5 jump seats) accompanied by a designated bike car.  My theory is that they want to direct bikes to the bike car and preserve those seats, but people with bikes don't want to walk to the front of the train.

It's a first world problem, of course, but I'm genuinely curious.  ","baltimore",9,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1kbrrnp/marc_bike_question/"

Staying in Reservoir Hill. What is the best way to structure my time and which neighborhoods should I see?

Considering a move from New England to MD to be closer to family.  I am in Maryland frequently but have spent embarrassingly little time in Baltimore, and would like to explore it well enough to decide if I should move there. Part of my family is in Howard County, and others around the Virginia area.

Im older and single. Right now Im in Providence, RI. Its a very unique situation that I wont be able to replicate elsewhere. For example, Im in a city, and literally every type of business I would need, including restaurants and shopping and my train, is within a one mile walk. Theres plentiful off-street parking behind my little condo, and the area is quiet, and super-safe. Great restaurants. My ideal home would be similar, particularly in terms of having a dedicated spot for my car and being mostly walkable as well as served by public transit. I can do 5-6 miles a day on foot and prefer having that exercise built into my day. I like having the car for getting out of the city or groceries, but dont want to be in a situation where I need it daily. Currently Im around the corner from a synagogue, and it would be a huge plus to be near a synagogue in my new place  one of the reasons Im actually looking at an urban area over the suburbs. (Fyi: I did read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/12qxltq/seeking_recommendations_for_the_perfect_synagogue/) already and found it really helpful). 

I am  going to visit Baltimore for four full days late in May to explore the city. I would greatly appreciate a list of neighborhoods to visit. I will be on foot, with the goal of experiencing what actual life would be like using public transit or walking. I am staying in the Reservoir Hill area. I realize that some of the things Im looking for are hard to find: I prefer living in urban areas, but also enjoy quiet and greenspaces (even if its just a patch of lawn in front of a rowhouse that I can call my own).

The transition would probably happen late 2025, so I am in the research stage. Of course the results of my job search will impact where I end up going. But right now I am lining up options.

Multiple doctors of mine want me to start biking as a gentle exercise, and seeing as I can't drive and live near some trails, I figure if I get a good enough helmet I might just survive biking in Baltimore (maybe). My first instinct was to look at city bikes, the kind that you sit upright for and only go one speed and are meant for leisurely rides, but looking into them it looks like they're not good for hills, and hoo boy are there are a lot of hills. They may not seem big, but they've been murder for me to even walk on. Actually, I was looking at an adult trike (I haven't ridden a bike in twelve years and I've since developed some neurological issues, so I'm a bit nervous on being on a two wheeler, but even my neuro team thinks I should bike), but it's the same issues with hills. Would a mountain bike be better? Or a hybrid? Or something else? I would only go maybe ten blocks away from home at a time, I don't have the endurance to travel far. Had I the funds for one, I'd get an ebike, but that's not an option right now. ","baltimore",29,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1k1co51/best_type_of_bicycle_for_baltimore/"

While hunting for your favorite duck dishes in the sub (as one does), I stumbled across a 12-year-old thread full of restaurant specials that absolutely delighted me. A true time capsule of mid-2010s dining deals and local hot takes.  

In the spirit of that threadand in the hopes we can revive the art of the weeknight specialIm tossing in a couple from Mt. Washington Tavern to get us started. Not a top pick food-wise, but Im a sucker for the ambience (and the decent parking, lets be honest):
	
      ""	Tuesdays: $18 Fish Night (salmon, tuna, or rockfish with sides)

	""	Wednesdays: $28 Prime Rib Night (with sides)

Good happy hour nightly food specials also welcome, although those are a bit easier to find/exist in other threads.

Now, back to the original mission: throw your favorite duck dishes out, if you please. Seared or confit, not Peking, although if you feel passionately, who am I to stop you?! My current fave is from Maggies Farmperfectly cooked, with a delicious accompanying risotto. Kudos to someone on a thread a few months ago who strongly recommended folks who had only been for brunch (=K<Ã¼@) give it a try for dinner.

Run out of their home, this is a small business run by musicians for musicians. Spider (the luthier) offers two levels of setup (for $25/$40, how awesome is that?) and they do full repairs. I dropped off my old 335 for new pots, (pain in the ass as a hollow body) but they called and said they could fix the ones on there if I wanted, which saved me money. They also serviced a 12 string for me as well that sounds and plays amazing.

They also sell used gear and pedals. Seriously, if you're a musician (on a budget or not) this shop--and these people--should be on your radar. Give them a shot, they'll earn your repeat business.

*Baltimore City Circuit Court Judge Lawrence P.

*To abate the damage caused by the companies, the city needs a whopping $5.2 billion, attorneys and expert witnesses argued late last year.*","baltimore",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1k2wcpo/the_clock_is_ticking_in_baltimores_landmark/"

*has a large enough area for at least 20 adults to be whimsical and fun.
*no kids close by. I don't mind kids in the area I guess? But not close enough that they will see the bubbles and come over. 
*has easy parking because pleeeeaaassseeeeeee
*much sun. Hopefully. 
*prefer in the county as that's where I live but there's flexibility.  
*please lord let the parking be easy. I will drive away bummed if i can't find the parking. 





Also I've made 2 batches of bubble solution but we will likely need more. I've already spent over $50 just today for supplies (with a donation from a lovely person from this sub! Thanks L!)
So I would really really appreciate if people could bring more supplies. We need
*dish soap. Dawn is preferred. But I think any will do. 
*corn syrup
*buckets of water. Distilled is best but any will do in a pinch.

"Looking for resources for injured semi-homeless friend","2025-04-23",1745431049,"Looking for resources for injured semi-homeless friend","Tried to crosspost but no luck.

tl;dr homeless guy with recently broken femur needs help.

A guy I know has been struggling for as long as I've known him (12 years or so) with bouts of homelessness and sketchy places to rent (at times living in a tiny windowless garage) along with being in recovery for an opioid addiction. I've been helping keep him afloat for ages and he was actually on his way to turning his situation around after finally obtaining an ID and applying for benefits when he was hit by a car several days ago and broke his femur, which has completely ruined his ability to do the odd jobs he normally does to make ends meet.

He has been staying with a ""friend"" of his for several months and paying some amount of rent to him, but less than a week back from the hospital with screws and rods in his leg, this ""friend"" lost his shit about him being unable to make money to pay him rent and kicked him out of the place.

My friend is now staying temporarily in a tent under the back porch of a neighbor he typically works for and has almost none of his possessions. I've offered to let him crash on my couch for a while but he's too proud to do so.

To compound the situation, he's in a methadone program and has been for years, and is dependent on it or he has withdrawal symptoms. He was prescribed a handful of opioid pain meds on discharge from the hospital, which he's long since run out of. Now he's dealing with both pain and the symptoms of not having access to his methadone. It's miserable. Even if he could get the methadone, it would only address half the problem and he'd still be in extreme pain.

Apparently he was discharged with instruction to contact a PT rehab, but he thought he could manage. Now days later he's suffering and had someone call an Uber to the same hospital for him last night. There wasn't much they could do and now he has to wait 3 more days for an ortho follow-up. No luck getting into a PT rehab so far.

He's pretty sure his ""friend"" he was staying with has likely already gone through and/or disposed of what he left behind, though I'm going to attempt to talk to him if I can catch him at home and see if I can take some essentials out of there.

He has already resorted to getting some morphine off the street to try and dull the pain and not get sick, which I understand but hate to think he might slide back into addiction if he can't get this situation resolved soon.

He's a really good guy that deserves better than the lot he's gotten from life, and I hate to see him suffer.

Long story short, can anyone advise on resources he might be able to work with, or anything else that might be of use? I'm offering food and drink, cash, and transportation when I can.

Location is near the Baltimore/AA County line.

Thanks for any advice.","baltimore",30,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1k65qxs/looking_for_resources_for_injured_semihomeless/"

Notably, during those two days, our pipes were frozen and we had proactively shut off the water at the main valve, making the reported consumption highly questionable.

I submitted a request to DPW but received no response for three weeks. Only after involving my councilman did I receive a reply. DPW then offered a 50% reduction on the overage, citing leaks in the home as the reason. However, there were no leaks, and my follow-up emails over the past week have gone unanswered. I called this morning and was told the 50% reduction is the only option available.

Anyhow! Im planning on going to a cross-cultural peace event in South Dakota &amp; maybe more over summer break (Im a teacher), and want to be able to communicate as best I can in Lakota to show respect for the Lakota people and culture. 

I have the Lakota language app and have done 24 levels in it, but its not geared to everyday conversation skills. Id love to practice some intro level dialogues with a native speaker before the trip. I can meet up in person or virtually, or a mix. 

I would also love to know of any classes or special events open to non-Lakota adults that may be available out there over the summer. Language, storytelling, drumming, handicrafts, powwows, etc. Or possible volunteer opportunities. Internet searches arent turning up much&

So I'm hoping I can get people interested in this fun, mushroom themed, worldwide, art scavenger hunt. It's June 14th, so a couple months left to make something. 



FYI, I have no association with the team that runs Game of Shrooms, just a fan and artist who likes to hide art within the community for the event. [Here's the website for the actual event.](https://yumfactory.com/projects/gameofshrooms/) But the TL/DR version is it's a single day to hide mushroom themed art for other people to find, it's a free worldwide event. All ages/abilities/skills welcome, the biggest rule is it's a leave no trace event so if your art isn't found on that day you're supposed to pick it back up. It was a fun time to run around with friends finding art and watching people find the mushrooms I hid, especially when little kids found the hidden shrooms.

"I cannot get on Medicaid due to a clerical error, how can I get free healthcare?","2025-04-08",1744077523,"I cannot get on Medicaid due to a clerical error, how can I get free healthcare?","I am a student making poverty pay with a remote job. Due to a clerical error (literally the only 1 in the state dealing with this, the office told me my best bet is to literally leave the state and move back for a new ID number) So, I cannot get on Medicaid. Despite qualifying. 
I am sick with a persistent infection that is not going away. I came here asking for food banks and you all pulled through. Any pointers for accessing free healthcare? I plan on leaving the state after I graduate. 

Post edit: the clerical error is & idk. It happened after I tried to change my MCO last year. Its been stuck in pending state approval status for over a year. When it came time for renrollment, my income verification just gets automatically denied. Even though its valid and hasnt changed from previous years. I work remote and employed by a global employer, and perhaps that is causing problems. To add insult to injury, I cannot use my bank accounts for verification. This is because November &amp; December last year, I received cash assistance from friends to help facilitate me moving out from my exes house. So far Ive used employer letters and self employed verification, both were denied numerous times despite Medicaid customer service telling me it would be accepted. The last time, I was accepted, then unenrolled 2 weeks later due to failing to verify, even though I did. I also cant get my MCO changed still.","baltimore",38,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1ju2igf/i_cannot_get_on_medicaid_due_to_a_clerical_error/"

On 3/19 it was used in a drive by in the city. The car ended up totaled. Someone passed away in the drive by. Its been awful. Yesterday, he got a speeding ticket in the mail for one of the cameras on 695 for $160. The back of the paper says if the car was stolen he has to request a hearing, show the police report (which he hasnt gotten yet), and pay court fees. Which means he misses a day of work and loses out on money that he needs to be able to purchase a new car. Im wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar and knows what he should do on this situation. Is there a way to just mail in a police report and skip the hearing? Or at this point it might be easier to just pay the $160. How much are court fees usually? ","baltimore",7,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1jv37x9/speeding_ticket_for_stolen_car/"

It's a partial basement (maybe 5/6 steps below ground) and I really liked it. The landlord is someone who used to live in the unit and lives half a block away, and seems very responsive. 

My concern is the risk of flooding given that it's a partial basement. He told me they have had a bit of water get in if there's a big storm and the drain outside is clogged, but no history of water damage. 

I loved the apartment and don't want to lose out on it, but I don't know the area that well and with weather patterns getting crazier every year, do you think it's relatively unlikely it'll flood with the history/location?

=Ã A major milestone for MTA Maryland!

Our bus system has achieved 80% On Time Performance (OTP) for the first time in over five years. This accomplishment reflects the dedication, professionalism, and daily commitment of our incredible bus operators and the entire bus management team.

4/16/25 was not only an 80% OTP for bus operations, they also had 0.03% cuts in service. Zero cut service for fleet availability. 

Light Rail and Metro Subway also had ZERO cut service for fleet availability or manpower.

Their hard work and focus on reliability make a real difference for our riders across the region.

=O Thank you for helping move Maryland forwardon time, every time.

"Where should a 76yo single grandpa live?","2025-04-02",1743628775,"Where should a 76yo single grandpa live?","My dad is 76 and wants to relocate from FL to the Baltimore area in order to be closer to us. We live in the county, Towson-ish area. His budget is 450k. He also drives an electric car so think garage access for charging. 

He thinks he wants a SFH but his budget puts him on the other side of the beltway, like 40 minutes from us. Still closer than Florida! I tell my wife. 

If I were in his position I would be looking for apartments or townhouses, I know some offer garages and really a 120v outlet is fine if they wont allow an install of a proper EV charger. 

Ive only lived here for a few years, and our budget for a house was larger so we had some options, so Im having a hard time figuring out neighborhoods.

"The Baltimore Rock Opera Society Presents - LEMPIRA - Oro y Sangre","2025-04-30",1746042476,"The Baltimore Rock Opera Society Presents - LEMPIRA - Oro y Sangre","Looking for a cool show in 2025? Come see the Baltimore Rock Opera Society's show - LEMPIRA!

Deep in the jungles of what is modern day Honduras and El Salvador, home of warring Lenca factions, Lempira's conquest is interrupted by an arrival of a dangerous new threat. Faced with the inevitability of colonial imperialism, Lempira must overcome his own pride, embrace a cause greater than himself, and unite the people he was once fighting against.

LEMPIRA is the massive mytho-historic tale of the invincible Lord of the Mountain, condensing a decades-long resistance against Spanish imperialism into one night of theatrical spectacle. Based on true events of Mesoamerican history &amp; mythology, this heavily stylized retelling is filled with Latin-inspired metal music, epic storytelling, and arresting visuals that capture the rich, awe-inspiring spirit of indigenous Latin American culture.

With characters who use both English and Spanish, we invite the audience to look past the barrier of language and identify with characters through their actions and song. Rest assured, there will be projected translations in both languages during the show.

Pitched by Sebastian Ochoa Arguijo, Written by Gabe Shatkin, Jamie Ginsberg, Lucas Gerace, and Nic Cole

Composed by Sebastian Ochoa Arguijo

Profundo en las selvas de lo que hoy son Honduras y El Salvador, hogar de facciones Lenca en guerra, la conquista de Lempira es interrumpida por la llegada de una nueva y peligrosa amenaza. Enfrentados con la incapacidad del colonialismo para el imperialismo, Lempira debe superar su propio orgullo, aceptar una causa mayor que el mismo, y unir a las personas con las que una vez luchÃ³.

LEMPIRA es la masiva leyenda mito-histÃ³rica del invencible seÃ±or de la montaÃ±a, condensando una resistencia desde hace dÃ©cadas contra el imperialismo espaÃ±ol en un noche de un espectÃ¡culo de teatro. EstÃ¡ basado en eventos reales de historia y mitologÃ­a Mesoamericana, este relato muy estilizado estÃ¡ lleno de mÃºsica metal de inspiraciÃ³n latina, narraciÃ³n Ã©pica, y visuales impactantes que capturan el espÃ­ritu rico e impresionante de la cultura indigena latinoamericana.

Con personajes que hablan inglÃ©s y espaÃ±ol, invitamos al pÃºblico a superar la barrera de idiomas e identificar a los personajes a travÃ©s de sus acciones y canto. No se preocupen, les aseguramos que proyectaremos traducciones en ambos idiomas durante el espectÃ¡culo.","baltimore",5,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1kbpk1a/the_baltimore_rock_opera_society_presents_lempira/"

My husband and I were very excited for this painting, but he said he was now living out of town so asked if I could pay for shipping. 

The next morning I sent him money to ship the painting and sent him our home address, thinking he would send it in the next couple days. 

Feb 28 I sent him a message asking for the status on the order, which he did not respond to. March 1 I sent him another message asking if it got put in the mail yet, and he said yes, but that if it doesnt arrive by Monday I can pick it up. He also sent a pic of some guy at the post office with empty packages (you could not seen ours in the picture). Obviously that doesnt make sense bc how would he have another copy of the first one was already in the mail, but I didnt say anything at the time. 

March 18 I reached out again and he said I can come pick it up in Towson. When I said I would be in Towson that night and could come get it, he didnt respond.  

Since then, I have sent him four messages, two of which hes read and two of which he hasnt read. He is constantly posting on his story and we have messaged before, so I know he sees the messages. 

Does anyone know this person? I want to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I feel like Im being scammed.

Everybody knows someone killed before their time because of a car crash.

Car prices, insurance, repairs, gas are all crazy expensive. 

Riding transit shouldn't suck nearly as much as it does. 

Office and service workers that can take transit to work should be able to. Without a ton of delays.

If more people took buses and trains to work (and buses and trains were easier to take because they didn't get delayed or have long headways), then blue collar workers with trucks or anyone else that needs to drive would experience a lot less traffic. 

Every time you stimatize taking the bus or train you are making your commute worse by adding cars to the traffic jams.

If that makes me a transit nerd then fuck it. Train does go choo choo so there is that.

"Great time (very briefly) visiting Baltimore, and some memories","2025-04-15",1744679118,"Great time (very briefly) visiting Baltimore, and some memories","I posted a couple weeks ago asking about good places to eat, as I was going to be in town for a conference. I got loads of helpful recommendations. Due to some scheduling issues, I only had time to have dinner at one of the recommended places, Koco's Pub, but it was well worth it.

I realize sometimes these highly recommended places can be overrated, but I will say the crab cake was outstanding. It was very large, all big chunks of crab, and perfectly seasoned. I don't normally drop 40 bucks on any kind of meal, but considering that crab cakes are nostalgic for me (my dad lived on Ednor Rd. in the 1970s), and that it really hit the spot, I have no regrets!

The really great part of my time there (really just one and half days) was how friendly everybody was. I don't mean the fake Zen Customer Service Smile. I mean a genuinely friendly and welcoming smile. Our server at one lunch (at a chain spot) overheard one of our group talking about something that interested her, and she stood there chatting with us for 15 minutes. She was so fun and smart and interesting (and the lunch crowd had emptied out, so she wasn't just goofing off). Everyone at the Pratt Street Ale house (the second lunch) was kind and welcoming, too. Same at Koco's. 

I kept bumping into that friendlinessLyft drivers, hotel staff, servers and proprietors, random people on the street. I saw an older guy walking his dog, which I confirmed was a Yorkie, and we had a nice brief exchange and again, the smile.

Yes, I'm sure the city like all cities has its problems (dirt bike culture doesn't intrigue me). But visiting if only for a day and a half made me even more nostalgic. Bear with me for this last part. Here are some memories:

* I remember my dad driving me and my brother through the city to get to his house, back around 1976-1980. We were just kids, but as Dad was an engineer, he took the most efficient route, which was right through the red light district. I remember wondering what ""Peep Shows"" were and why they were 25 cents. And why there were so many ""Girls, Girls, Girls,"" and what ""XXX"" meant.
* I remember in the same basic area a tavern that served, as the sign said, ""Grub and Firewater."" I thought those were cool words. 
* I remember how differently houses were set up on a city block compared to the house in Rockville where I lived most of the time with my momthe shared walls (I remember hearing the neighbors fighting), the alleys, the little detached garages, the tiny but well-tended little yards. 
* I remember Dad taking us to Fells Point and some other fish market, where we had codfish cakes (sandwiched between saltines spread with mustard). We also had milkshakes that were made with a hand-cranked machine. 
* I remember walking with Dad's next-door neighbor family to see ""Love at First Bite"" (Dad stayed home), and afterwards going into a dark, smoky bar (the parents asked if we kids could come in). It was like nothing I'd ever seen before (or since, really). 
* I remember going to sleep with the windows open and hearing the crowd roaring a few blocks up at Memorial Stadium. That was pretty magical (and we did see a few games there, too).

Excerpt (MODS deleted post with whole article) 


The offices are dark, the doors are locked. Abandoned buildings and empty lots, ringed by slumped metal fences, are stark reminders of promises gone bust.
This is the state of the Baltimore real estate empire of the Chasen Cos., whose namesake founder just a few years ago boasted of plans to spend $100 million on expanding his boutique housing brand across the United States. These days, Brandon Chasen is keeping a much lower profile.
Punch in his number: The wireless customer you are calling is unavailable.
Chasen Cos. unraveling can be seen and felt throughout the city.

On Thursday, a judge granted a petition from creditors to force the construction arm of Chasen Cos. into bankruptcy. The business did not contest the legal action.
In Fells Point, once the center of the companys development efforts, neighbors have noticed people trespassing and littering inside the unfinished structures, said Kate Simms, president of the Fells Point Residents Association.

Whether you're a seasoned film buff or just getting interested in movies, this club is a place to meet other movie fans in Baltimore, watch and discuss films, and even show your own movies if you're a filmmaker yourself.

We had our first show in February with Jean-Luc Godard's sci-fi cult classic ""Alphaville"". Last month we screened a program of new indie short films with some of the filmmakers in attendance to talk about their work. Programming will alternate between showing movies from the Pratt Library 16mm film collection, and works from local filmmakers - so if you make films/music videos/experimental video art and want to show your latest creations at a future Beyond the Frame, come out and connect at our next show. 

This month, our film is Alfred Hitchcock's rarely-shown espionage classic ""Sabotage"". We're meeting on Saturday April 26 from 1-3PM, at Enoch Pratt Central Library in the First Floor Makerspace (located directly behind the Best &amp; Next Department).

The club is FREE and does not require registration to attend. Just show up, enjoy the movie, and stick around to chat afterwards!","baltimore",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1jsuyhj/beyond_the_frame_new_movie_club_at_enoch_pratt/"

I wasn't sure that he was talking to me, so I didn't respond. He got all up in my face and was yelling at me about why was I ignoring him, etc etc. I'm sick of it. I love this city, and on the streets I feel safe, and I have great interactions with people. But on the transit? Totally different story. I'm tired of this shit. I have taken transit in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver, London, Brussels, Amsterdam, and more. And I have never had any issues at all. I recently went car free, and the MTA has been getting me around fine, but ever since I moved here I've had constant issues with safety, and it's getting worse now that I take transit more. The incidents on the Light Rail and Pink bus happened less than two weeks apart. I don't know what to do anymore. I shouldn't have to fear for my safety every time I need to get somewhere. Rant over.

Were currently looking for:
"" Volunteers to help clean and maintain the fridge
"" Neighbors who can donate food

Whether you can spare a few minutes to wipe down shelves or drop off an extra loaf of breadevery bit helps keep this resource going strong.

Wed also love for folks to spread the word, especially to those who could benefit. Please dont hesitate to use the fridgeits here for you. Whether youre in a tough spot or just need a few items to get through the week, take what you need.

One of the busier coffee drive thrus in the area. The lady in front of the drive thru window had a jeep and it stopped working. 

After a failed attempt by store employees to push the vehicle forward (it would not shift into neutral) the lady called a tow truck.

Rest of the people in the queue had to reverse out of the line and pickup their order inside. 

Every one did pretty well with adjusting to the hiccup. Which I would not have guessed because people can be irritable pre-coffee. 

People arriving and turning around after seeing the drive thru was closed was a bit of a mess. 

Store employees were patient and figured it out. Kudos to them.

"Just got back from vacation in Bmore and loved every minute I was there.","2025-04-22",1745355503,"Just got back from vacation in Bmore and loved every minute I was there.","I just got home from spending a week in Baltimore and absolutely loved my time there. Here's the highlights of what I saw and my favorite bits.



I spent some serious time in museums around the city and loved every one of them:



1. **The National Great Blacks in Wax Museum**: I started my trip here. It was the first place I went after dropping my bags off. I got there early and it was just me for a while; later, a school group came through, too. Before that, one of the staff members, a young guy, walked me through and talked about the museum overall and other museums he likes in Baltimore and elsewhere. This museum pulls no punches. It celebrates greatness and mourns tragedy.



2. **The American Visionary Art Museum**: This was probably my favorite museum overall I saw. Most museums have placards next to paintings that say things like: ""This painter was born in Paris and studied under such and such in the year of..."" Not here. This place has things like handwoven portraits made from threads from socks; the portraits were traded for cigarettes in prison where the artist was incarcerated. You don't see stories like that elsewhere. This place rocks.



3. **The Baltimore Museum of Art**: Beautiful building, gorgeous collection, but the real gem here is the tiered sculpture garden. I just sat in the garden for a long while, taking in the serenity, and wishing I was just outside the wall, where a dude had set up a stand selling Chai that smelled amazing.



4. **The Walters Museum of Art** - My hotel was nearby. I think I went here every day I could. Absolutely adored this place. The staff got to know me, I spent so much time here. Love the collection, love the old and new buildings being joined together. Very cool.



5. **The aquarium and the zoo.** Both good, but not the type of museum-ish attractions I usually go to, so while I enjoyed both, I think I'm not the target audience.



6. **The B&amp;O Railroad Museum**: Very cool! I got a lot of neat pictures. Don't take the train ride, though. I thought it'd be quirky and fun and informative. It was a modern mass transit train that went through a quarter mile of brush; I was surrounded by screaming children and tired parents. Not great, don't recommend, but the museum itself was sweet.


7. **The Museum of Industry** - This place ruled. A celebration of true blue union / trade work. I watched an hour long video of lithography and then saw the lithographs elsewhere in the museum. The Packard, the neon dot from the old sugar factory, the reproduced shops, etc. This place is seriously cool.




I hung out in a few neighborhoods throughout the week. Usually, I'd get dropped off somewhere to see one thing, and then I'd go for long walks through the neighborhood to see what's what. The two I spent the most time in:


1. **Hampden**: Loved Common Grounds. Loved Bazaar, and even loved the Ouija Museum above it, though it's just a little bit overpriced. Loved Atomic Books, the record shop next to it, and all of the shops and odds and ends along the main drag there. I think I spent the most time wandering around here.


2. **Fells Point**: I saw a show at Vagabond Theater one night and then walked around the neighborhood, getting a contact high from the dense cloud of weed smoke that settled on everything in the evening humidity. I loved the vibe, and loved hanging out by the water. Met some really cool folks. The next morning, I came back for brunch and strolled around in daylight. I loved this spot.




I ate some killer food. The highlights:


1. **Peter's Inn** - I ate here my first night. Oysters, pasta in short rib ragu, vanilla bean gelato with fennel pollen and Spanish olive oil. And the two strongest cocktails I've ever had. I was practically stumbling out of there after. This place was bonkers. Amazing food, amazing staff.


2. **Blue Moon Cafe** - One of the best brunches I've had in my entire life. I tried one of their cinnamon buns and the Sweet Baby Jesus. Delicious. Utterly stupidly amazingly delicious. And, I loved the classic horror movie decor.


3. **Benny's** - Their balls are justly celebrated. I got the meatballs with polenta and focaccia. I will dream of these meatballs. They were so damn good.


4. **Penny Black** - Pretty good! Fairly standard bar fare with some panache. I liked the food I had here, but I didn't love it quite as much as the other places I went.



5. **Faidley's**: Lexington Market is such a cool spot! I got the lump crab cake here with some sides. It was mighty damn delicious. Overall, though, I wish I had gone to Broadway Market that day and gotten Polish food from the deli there. Next time.



6. **Chuck's Trading Post**: Jesus Christ was this brunch good. If I lived in Hampden I'd weigh 700 pounds and it would entirely be from food eaten here. I had a breakfast scramble with their homemade chorizo, some grits, tried a pancake, coffee, then tried to work it off by doing some more laps around Hampden. Oh God, I loved this food.




7. **The Charmery**. I tried Old Bay caramel ice cream. It was fucking delicious. Sweet and a little spicy. Just right.





Other Odds and Ends:




1. The B-Side speakeasy in Hotel Revival is fun, but not $60 for two cocktails fun. I could see it being a fun date spot. At least I think it would be, since I saw one guy bring two or three different girls there in the week or so that I stayed there.



2. I went for a lovely stroll through Mt. Vernon, eventually finding a weed dispensary where someone set up a gourmet hot dog and slider tent in the parking lot. I had Peter's Inn slated for that night so I didn't partake of the hot dogs, though they smelled great. The weed was just fine. It's pretty much the same stuff we have in the med program up here in PA. Same companies, somewhat comparable prices.


3. I went to the Pinball event at Holy Frijoles over the weekend and had a blast playing on a bunch of different machines. Kudos to the planners, because everyone I saw there was having an amazing time, it seemed. Very cool event.



A jam packed couple of days, and I loved every minute. Cool town y'all got there! I can't wait to visit again and dig in deeper. Thanks, Baltimore!","baltimore",86,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1k5hdyw/just_got_back_from_vacation_in_bmore_and_loved/"

It ended up being one of the best trips I've ever made. Every single person I've met was beyond friendly, the food was unbelievable, coolest baseball stadium I've ever seen. At point I went for a walk at 2am (not a good idea, but whatever - i was a bit over the sloshed side), a group of guys were having a barbeque on the sidewalk. $2 hamburgers and I engulfed multiple. 

It also turned me into an Orioles fan. I do think the NHL should have a team there though as well.

I'm also neurodivergent. My current hyperfixation is bubbles. I make big ass, size of a medium sized dog, type bubbles. I was wondering if anyone would want to hangout and play bubbles with me.  
I'm kind of technical about it and I'm working on my recipie. So it'd be cool if you would be willing to give feedback on your experience. 

I just wanna make bubbles in the warm sun and play my uke. 

I'm not super familiar with the area but I can drive to meet you. Im typically looking to hang around 630 on weeknights. Not long. Maybe an hour or so? We can do bubbles, read, play instruments (i have a few ukeleles) etc. Also available for weekend hangouts on occasion.

Please comment here if youre interested. Before you DM me. 


THIS IS FOR ADULTS.  NOT KIDS. I DONT WANT TO DO BUBBLES WITH YOU AND YOUR TODDLERS. THEYRE GONNA POP ALL MY BUBBLES AND PISS ME OFF. I also work with kids and eat, sleep, and breathe toddler crap so I just want to hang with adults.

Edit: i am down for driving and meeting people places to do bubbles but please make parking easy. I hate driving/parking in cities. Parallel parking isn't the issue (im great) but finding spaces close to destinations is a hassle i can't deal with.

"How do we get benches at BWI light rail stop?","2025-04-04",1743811068,"How do we get benches at BWI light rail stop?","I legitimately love having a train disembark right at our airport terminal. Tons of cities with significantly better transit than Baltimore dont have this convenience. Do I need it to come more often than twice an hour (when operating under ideal conditions)? Yes. Yes, I do.

But every time Im sitting on the stoop next to the rail lines, or climbing on the ramp railings, or standing around for these lengthy wait times theyve set us up for, I always wonder who we need to bother to get a bunch more benches installed. Theres plenty of space where they were presumably designed to go. There are two, so it was clearly an intentional choice by whoever was managing the stop to only put in two. But I dont actually understand what that accomplishes.

I think its horrible, but at least I understand what cruel people are thinking when they remove benches from parks or bus stops. They dont want people to linger, and they think making it uncomfortable and hostile will chase people away. But how does that logic apply at the airport? They already have security recordings playing throughout the terminal threatening to trespass anyone who doesnt have legal business there. The high fences, security cameras, and constant police presence send a loud enough signal that everyone should be afraid of sitting too long.

All that having just two lonely benches accomplishes is creating a scene of people standing around, sitting on the rail tracks, old folks sitting on the ground. Ive seen a mother literally sitting on the ground next to a stroller. If the fear is creating a deplorable scene at the airport, putting up a bunch of comfy benches would solve the problem. Besides basic common sense, its also humaneand would mostly benefit airport travelers, who are presumably a demographic MTA and the city want to cater to.

This is me crying into the wind because I have no idea how to get the ball rolling on this, or if it already is, or who to write to if it isnt.","baltimore",40,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1jrqf58/how_do_we_get_benches_at_bwi_light_rail_stop/"

"Baltimore on track for another huge drop in homicides in 2025!","2025-04-17",1744920122,"Baltimore on track for another huge drop in homicides in 2025!","Through the first 3 months of the year, we had 34 murders. Obviously this is early, and terrible for the families involved, but the macro trend is still looking really good.

Over the last 6 months rolling we've had 84 killings. Extrapolating this out for 1yr we are on track for \~170, but the first 3 months of the year are even better. Year over year were down from 46 to 34, a 25% drop, which would put us on track for \~150 for the year, again a huge improvement.

Remains to be seen how the economic uncertainty affects this progress, but this would be an absolute incredible improvement. Truly miraculous change. Kudos to everyone working so hard to make this happen!

PS: It won't let me post a link to the stats, but you can google them yourselves if you want to verify. ","baltimore",44,"https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1k1m89t/baltimore_on_track_for_another_huge_drop_in/"

This was truly a unique and wonderful dining experience. The staff was friendly and the service was impeccable. My husband and I went after Opening Day (a tradition to go for a nice meal while childless for the evening), and this did not disappoint. The food was fabulous. It was probably the best rockfish I've ever had, and the vegetables were so flavorful (the rapini had a soy, sesame, peanut flavor that was incredible and the cabbage had a nice ginger flavor and it didn't seem like I was eating cabbage at all). If you're in Hampden, definitely check it out.

My neighborhood is up and coming and my street is filling up pretty quickly. My neighbor that lives at the very end on the other side of the street has 2 trucks.

Im pretty sure hes already been reported by someone for doing the same thing to them. I almost never have parking in front of my house because for some reason he wont move even when there are multiple spots in front of his house. I dont understand. 

Most of the people on our street dont live on the same end as him so its basically crowded on my side and empty on his. Its obviously intentional and not illegal so Im just annoyed with no real solution. That is all.
