The following information was released by the Maryland Attorney General:
Attorney General Anthony G. Brown today announced that seven defendants have pleaded guilty in the Longwood-North-Dukeland (LND) drug-trafficking case, which the Office of the Attorney General announced earlier this year.
In May 2023, the Attorney General's Organized Crime Unit, Baltimore City Police Department's (BPD) Group Violence Unit, and the DEA - Washington Division's Baltimore District Office began a joint investigation into the members and associates of a drug-trafficking organization operating in the northwest section of Baltimore City. The organization's members referred to the area in which they conducted their criminal activity as "LND," short for Longwood-North-Dukeland, which are names of streets located in and around the:
3100 block of West North Avenue;
1800 block of North Rosedale Street;
3100 block of Westwood Avenue; and
Intersection of West North Avenue and North Dukeland Street.
"Drugs and guns poison our communities and force our neighbors to live in violence and fear," said Attorney General Brown. "These investigations took illegal firearms and dangerous drugs off our streets, and the sentences send a clear message to traffickers that they will be held accountable for their criminal behavior. My office will do whatever it can to keep Marylanders safe from crime."
The investigation utilized a variety of methods, including undercover BPD detectives making controlled purchases of firearms and narcotics, including fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine. In January 2024, multiple search warrants were executed, including one at the home of the gun supplier for the organization, Micquan Leonard, in Baltimore County. A search of his home led to the recovery of 10 firearms and cocaine. The 10 firearms included two illegal assault rifles, two stolen firearms, and a ghost gun.
Three other cases remain pending. Keon Powell, 32, of Baltimore, is set for trial on January 7, 2025. Two other defendants remain in warrant status. Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Eric Steven Smith, 59, or Martina Staggers, 52, should contact the Baltimore City Sheriff's Office at (410) 396-7591. A criminal indictment is merely an accusation of wrongdoing, and a defendant is presumed innocent until the State proves the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
In making today's announcement, Attorney General Brown thanked his Criminal Division, specifically Criminal Division Deputy Chief Jared Albert, Assistant Attorney General Shannon Price, and Assistant Attorney General Eric Sullivan, who are prosecuting these cases. Attorney General Brown also thanked Baltimore County Police Department Chief Robert O. McCullough, State's Attorney for Baltimore City Ivan J. Bates, and State's Attorney for Baltimore County Scott Shellenberger for their assistance in this investigation and prosecution.
