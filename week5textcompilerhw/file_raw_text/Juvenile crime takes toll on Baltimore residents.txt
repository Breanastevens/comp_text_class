Over the last week, juvenile crime has taken a toll on some Baltimore City residents.
Tuesday, three juveniles carjacked a female at gunpoint, leading police on a chase, before crashing. Within 24 hours, they were back on the streets, under the supervision of a GPS monitor.
Baltimore Police confirm the trio all have previous arrests for stolen vehicles.
Wednesday, a 12-year-old and 14-year-old were arrested for an armed robbery of another juvenile. According to the victim, one of the juveniles put a gun against his stomach.
The 12-year-old had been arrested for robbery five other times and was under GPS monitoring at the time.
Friday, police were searching for a juvenile they say may be responsible for gunfire that left a Federal Hill home struck by a bullet. Witnesses tell FOX45 that the juvenile was trying to shoot two other juveniles.
As the crime travels around Baltimore, residents across the city are sounding off.
Owen Lyons lives in Federal Hill, on the street where his neighbor's house was struck by a bullet.
"There seems to be not enough consequence for that kind of activity because it seems to be prevalent all over Baltimore," said Lyons.
According to Baltimore Police, over a dozen juveniles were arrested this past week for serious crimes.
