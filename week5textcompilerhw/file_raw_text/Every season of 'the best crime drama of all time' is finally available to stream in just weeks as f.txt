All seven seasons of a popular old-school police drama will be available to stream in just weeks.
The award-winning show, Homicide: Life On The Street, first aired in 1993 and became one of the most celebrated crime series in history - winning the Peabody Award three times and four Emmy Awards. 
Now, after a deal with Fremantle, the classic series has been revamped in HD and UHD and will be broadcast by Sky and NOW in the UK and Ireland from February 14.
The police drama, which ran for 122 episodes, features a talented cast including the late Brooklyn Nine-Nine star Andre Braughner who passed away in 2023, Richard Belzer from Law & Order and award-winning actress Melissa Leo. 
Based on David Simon's book, Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, the timeless show delves into crime scenes in Baltimore inspired by real murder cases in the 1990s.
Each drama-filled episode explores the detective work of the Baltimore Police Department's homicide squad as the team tackles child murders, gang crime and hostage situations. 
The series features guest stars alongside it's talent cast, including Chris Rock, Robin Williams, Paul Giamatti, Jake Gyllenhaal, Luis Guzmán, Edie Falco, Marcia Gay Harden, Vincent D'Onofrio and Steve Buscemi.
Homicide: Life on the Street has been highly praised and Vulture's Margaret Lyons hailed it as the best police drama 'of all time' back in 2014.
Fans of the show have praised it online, including one Reddit user who, wrote they were 'completely blown away' after watching it on DVD.
They penned: 'I was & still am completely blown away by this series. Superb characterization, great acting and plots, and I loved the documentary-style filming., i.e. the hand-held camera; very innovative & edgy for the time period.
'I know a lot of TV crime drama fans may disagree with me about this, but after seeing this a second time around - I find this series the best TV crime drama of all time, hands down.
'The series was very innovative, even by today's standards.' 
Someone else who has watched the series posted on X: 'I've been watching Homicide: Life on the Street for the first time and it's pretty good. Not much propaganda, fairly realistic, and doesn't treat the viewer like an idiot.
'Apparently it was based upon a book by the guy who made The Wire, so that makes sense.' 
Another fan said: 'Pleased to see Homicide: Life on the Street finally come back to UK TV. Starts on Sky Atlantic from 14th Feb.'
One penned: 'Finished watching all seven seasons (and the movie) of Homicide: Life on the Street. Truly excellent show. 
'Fundamental, groundbreaking storytelling that was a springboard for so much television that came after it. Only wish I could've seen it with the original licensed music.' 
Jamie Morris, Executive Director Content Strategy and Performance for Sky, described it as an 'iconic series' and expressed his excitement at its return. 
He said: 'We're delighted that this iconic series is coming to the UK and Ireland and cannot wait for our customers to experience all seven series.
'Homicide: Life on the Street set the bar for some of the greatest series of all-time, many of which you can watch on Sky and NOW alongside this legendary drama which has been lovingly restored.'
It comes after the hit 1990s show which originally aired on NBC in America became available to stream for the first time in August last year on Peacock. 
Issues with music rights had prevented viewers from streaming the popular police procedural until then. 
On the show, Andrew Braugher portrayed the brilliant but arrogant Detective Frank Pembleton, often alienated himself from his other team members.
His portrayal of Detective Pembleton was considered his breakout role, and he starred in the show for six seasons.
Richard Belzer portrayed Detective John Munch - the clever and cynical homicide unit member who weathered four failed marriages and bad breakups.
Richard was one of the show's four stars who starred in all seven seasons.
The show also starred Clark Johnson as the goofy but serious Detective Meldrick Lewis, Kyle Secor as the emotionally invested Detective Tim Bayliss, and Yaphet Kotto as the unit's demanding but protective Lieutenant Gee Giardello. 
Homicide: Life on the Street will air on Sky and Now on February 14.
