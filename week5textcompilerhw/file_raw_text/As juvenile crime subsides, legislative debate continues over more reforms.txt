Juvenile crime is not on the rise in Baltimore overall, but a perceived crisis in the city contributed to a state law that passed this year, rolling back some of the provisions of a more progressive law passed just two years before.
In passing the law, which took effect Nov. 1, Maryland joined a growing list of states to pass tougher juvenile crime laws in recent years. Several states have passed or are considering bills that require children to be charged as adults for serious offenses.
In Baltimore, youth account for just 5% of arrests by the Baltimore Police Department this year, according to BPD data analyzed by the Sentencing Project  a decrease from 10% in 2016. Carjackings, which are commonly blamed on young people, are more frequent than they were before the pandemic, but they’re trending downward after a spike in 2023.
Juvenile crime as a whole  with some exceptions  appears to be trending down. Nationwide, arrests and detention of juveniles declined by about 75% from 2000 to 2022.
Still, the juvenile justice system takes a disproportionate toll on Black children. Maryland prosecutes children as adults more frequently than almost any other state, and the majority  about 80%  of children in adult court are Black, experts say.
In the upcoming session, lawmakers are expected to consider legislation that would reduce the number of crimes for which minors are automatically charged as adults, giving juvenile court judges the discretion to keep kids out of the adult system.
Andre Davis, a former federal appellate judge and Baltimore City solicitor, is now chairing a new juvenile justice reform commission, which has met twice since last month. The committee is in the information-gathering stage, but is required to issue policy recommendations.

Davis said the state needs “significant reform in the way that we respond to antisocial conduct by young people,” but that the problem isn’t as severe as many believe it to be.
“I think there’s a real difference between perception and reality,” Davis told The Daily Record. “I think that the problem of so-called ‘juvenile crime’ is not nearly the crisis that some of the reporting in the media would suggest. That’s my perspective. ”
What the data show
Another recent report by The Sentencing Project blames local news media for the perception of a juvenile crime crisis in Baltimore.
The nonprofit research and advocacy group, which opposes mass incarceration and racial disparities in the criminal justice system, studied crime coverage by four local TV stations, The Baltimore Banner and The Baltimore Sun in the first half of 2024.

It found that, to varying degrees, “they have been providing their audiences with skewed and misleading information about youth crime. ”
By far, Fox45, Sinclair Broadcast Group’s flagship station, published the most stories about juvenile crime, and used more of what the report deemed “sensationalized” or “fear-inducing rhetoric” than the other outlets.
“Many media outlets are mischaracterizing isolated short-term increases from artificially low offending rates during the pandemic as a major new teen crime wave,” the report states.
In Baltimore, youth arrests have been declining in recent months after an increase from early 2021 to the end of 2023. BPD arrested 51 minors in July 2024, and a monthly average of 65 minors this year.
By comparison, Baltimore police arrested an average of 198 minors per month in 2017 and 134 per month in 2019.

Only 5% of people  one in 20 people  arrested by BPD this year have been under 18, below the national average by a few percentage points. Youth have accounted for no more than 9% of BPD arrests since 2017, when they made up 12%. But more than half of Fox45’s crime stories, according to The Sentencing Project, focused on crimes committed by youth.
The city saw 300-400 carjackings  a crime often attributed to minors, although incident reports do not identify the offenders  each month from 2018 through 2022. That number spiked to more than 1,600 carjackings in mid-2023, an increase that saw frequent media coverage. Monthly carjackings have since decreased to about 55o per month  significantly above pre-pandemic levels, but a third of last year’s high.
Nationally, despite the general decrease in crime, more young people used guns and committed homicides in 2022 as compared to 2016, according to the Council on Criminal Justice. The rates of burglary, larceny and robbery all decreased.

Vincent Schiraldi, secretary of the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services, said homicides committed by youth are down this year according to last year, Maryland Matters reported.
DJS did not respond to a request for an interview with Schiraldi. State Del. Luke Clippinger, D-Baltimore City and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who sponsored the bill that took effect last month, did not follow up on requests for comment.
Details of the new law
HB814, the law that took effect Nov. 1, allowed children as young as 1o to be referred to juvenile court for “specified crimes involving weapons, firearms, cruelty to animals, sexual offenses, and motor vehicle theft,” according to an analysis by the legislature. A 2022 law had prohibited children younger than 13 from being criminally charged except for certain violent offenses.
Among other provisions, the law also expands probationary periods.
The law also created a commission, chaired by Davis, that will study best practices to hold people accountable while preventing trauma and racial disparities.
Maryland Public Defender Natasha Dartigue has been one of the law’s most vocal opponents, describing it in a press release as a “crime bill that dismantles the protections established by the 2022 Juvenile Justice Reform Act, disregards best practices for addressing delinquent behavior, and fails to look at long term impact. ”
While BPD is arresting fewer children in Baltimore, more are being charged as adults; the vast majority are Black.

According to WYPR, Sen. Will Smith, D-Montgomery and chairman of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, who sponsored the new juvenile justice law, wants to pass a bill that would decrease the number of crimes for which children are automatically sent to adult court. The idea has been proposed several times in recent years.
Davis said he recently learned that juvenile court judges very rarely disagree when DJS officials determine a minor should be detained  a fact that hit him “like a ton of bricks. ”
“If you make a mistake and detain a kid who really shouldn’t be detained, that is really corrosive of the system,” he said.
Michael Pinard, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Law, runs a legal clinic through which law students represent kids who are facing expulsion, suspension or other discipline at school, with the goal of keeping them out of the juvenile and criminal justice systems.
When students are disciplined at school, they’re more likely to become involved in the criminal justice system, he said. Pinard said his work gives him a “bird’s eye view of the trajectory between school discipline, criminalization and long-term incarceration,” particularly for Black people.
“This is a state that really, truly, hyper-criminalizes its Black citizens,” Pinard said.
“It is very easy to be suspended or expelled from school,” he said. “They are owed the opportunity to put this situation in context. . . I think that the systems aren’t necessarily designed to do that. ”
