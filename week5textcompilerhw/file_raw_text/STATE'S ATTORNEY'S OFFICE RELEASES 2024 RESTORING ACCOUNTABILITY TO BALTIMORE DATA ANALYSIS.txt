The following information was released by the Office of the State's Attorney for Baltimore City:
1064 violent offenders have been removed from Baltimore's streets annually under the Bates Administration
Today, the Office of the State's Attorney for Baltimore City released the 2024 Restoring Accountability to Baltimore Data Analysis, which demonstrates how skillful, coordinated prosecution efforts and increased staffing have contributed to the incarceration of more violent repeat offenders and an overall reduction in violent crime. The publication of this data is yet another step in State's Attorney Ivan J. Bates' commitment to transparency and accountability.
"Since taking office in January 2023, my executive team and I have worked in collaboration with our local and federal partners in public safety to revive the Office of the State's Attorney and reinvigorate our staff to work efficiently and effectively for the people of Baltimore," said State's Attorney Bates. "My prosecutors are achieving more convictions in the courtroom of repeat violent offenders and trigger-pullers, securing lengthier sentences, dropping fewer cases, and enhancing victim and witness support. Our renewed relationships with the Baltimore Police, the U.S. Attorney's Office, ATF, DEA, and the Sheriff's Office have made the successes we are seeing possible. I sincerely thank these essential partners in law enforcement and the community at large for supporting our work to build a safer city for our children."
2024 Restoring Accountability to Baltimore Data Analysis
*Numbers are approximate and based on available court data, in addition to internal disposition data.
As fewer cases involving illegal possession of guns have been dismissed, more potential trigger-pullers are incarcerated, and more cases are referred for federal prosecution, the homicide rate has dropped.
Since July 2022, the State's Attorney's Office has added 70 more staff members to the team. This essential support has reduced caseloads, increased prosecutorial support, and enhanced services for victims and witnesses.
Since 2023, State's Attorney Bates has secured convictions for 2129 individuals who had an illegal firearm with a felony criminal record, were selling drugs while illegally carrying a firearm, or committed a murder or attempted to commit a murder while using a firearm. These individuals were sentenced to incarceration with a minimum of 5 years without the possibility of parole, resulting in an average of 1064 violent offenders being removed from Baltimore's streets annually under the Bates Administration.
