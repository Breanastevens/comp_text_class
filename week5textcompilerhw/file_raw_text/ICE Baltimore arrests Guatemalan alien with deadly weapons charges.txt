ICE Baltimore arrests Guatemalan alien with deadly weapons charges
BALTIMORE -- U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement apprehended an undocumented Guatemalan alien with criminal charges. Gener Pop-Cuz, 20, was arrested Feb. 1, after the Prince George's County Department of Corrections declined to honor ICE's immigration detainer.
The corrections department released Pop into the lobby, instead of safely handing him over to the ICE deportation officer who was waiting for the exchange, and he resisted arrest during the initial encounter. However, Pop was eventually subdued and placed in handcuffs as corrections officers failed to intervene.
"Nobody wins when jurisdictions fail to transfer custody of violent offenders," said ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Baltimore acting Field Office Director Matthew Elliston. "Cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE is critical to ensuring the safety of our officers, the public, and even the criminal aliens in custody. I strongly encourage our local jurisdictions to evaluate their policies and look forward to the day when we can put aside politics and do what's best for the people of Maryland."
The U.S. Border Patrol encountered Pop near Rio Grande Valley, Texas, Nov. 13, 2017, and served him a notice to appear, transferring him to ICE custody on the same date. ICE released Pop on an order of recognizance Nov. 15, 2017.
A Department of Justice immigration judge ordered Pop removed to Guatemala Nov. 16, 2022, after he failed to show for his immigration hearing.
The Laurel Police Department arrested and charged Pop on Feb. 1 with possession of a loaded handgun, illegal possession of ammunition, possession of a firearm, and trespassing on private property. He was released on bond by the Prince George's County Commissioner's Office the same date. ICE then lodged an immigration detainer on Pop with the Prince George's County Department of Corrections in Upper Marlboro.
Pop will remain in the custody of ICE pending removal.
ERO conducts removals of individuals without a lawful basis to remain in the United States, including at the order of immigration judges with the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review. EOIR is a separate entity from DHS and ICE. Immigration judges in these courts make decisions based on the merits of each individual case, determining if a noncitizen is subject to a final order of removal or eligible for certain forms of relief from removal.
Detainers are critical public safety tools because they focus enforcement resources on removable noncitizens who have been arrested for criminal activity. Detainers increase the safety of all parties involved -- ERO personnel, law enforcement officials, the removable noncitizens and the public -- by allowing an arrest to be made in a secure and controlled custodial setting as opposed to at-large within the community. Since detainers result in the direct transfer of a noncitizen from state or local custody to ERO custody, they also minimize the potential that an individual will reoffend. Additionally, detainers conserve scarce government resources by allowing ERO to take criminal noncitizens into custody directly rather than expending resources locating these individuals at-large.
Members of the public can report crimes and suspicious activity by dialing 866-DHS-2-ICE (866-347-2423) or completing the online tip form.
