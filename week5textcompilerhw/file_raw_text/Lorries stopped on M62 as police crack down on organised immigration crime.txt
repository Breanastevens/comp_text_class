Lorries were stopped and searched using thermal imaging cameras as part of a major crackdown on organised immigration crime. Officers targeted heavy goods vehicles HGVs on the M62 in Greater Manchester on Friday night November 15.
Thermal imaging cameras were used to detect unusual heat coming from the vehicles, which could indicate a person being smuggled. An image shared by Greater Manchester Police on social media shows the technology being put to use.
It's part of a policing operation called Project Invigor, which is designed to tackle organised immigration crime. According to the National Crime Agency NCA, Project Invigor targets the criminal networks behind people smuggling, with operations taking place in the UK and overseas.
It involves the NCA, Border Force, Immigration Enforcement, police forces and the Crown Prosecution Service. While officers were checking for immigration-related offences on the M62, police noticed a number of other road safety offences being committed.
GMP Traffic says its officers handed out a number of graduated fixed penalty notices GFPNs and seized a lorry which was being driven by someone without a valid licence. A GMP Traffic spokesperson wrote on X on Friday night: "Officers from GMP roads policing unit were out tonight working Operation Invigor tackling organised immigration crime. 
"Using new Thermal imaging cameras on HGV's travelling along the M62. Numerous GFPNs issued, a HGV seized section 165 to list a few of the offences detected."
