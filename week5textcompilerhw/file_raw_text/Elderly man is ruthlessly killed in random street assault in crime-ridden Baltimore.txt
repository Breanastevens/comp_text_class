READ MORE: Man dies after he was sedated and restrained by Baltimore medics
An elderly veteran was killed in a seemingly random street assault in crime-ridden Baltimore.
Shocking footage captured the moment David Philpot, 74, was brutally attacked in broad daylight after the suspect reportedly asked him for money.
Philpot, a Vietnam veteran who friends describe as 'the nicest guy on the planet,' was walking his beloved dog Chip near the corner of Eastern Ave and Ann when he was assaulted.
The incident occurred on Saturday at around 2:45pm. Philpot died from his injuries shortly after.
Surveillance footage obtained by Fox45 shows the horrifying attack unfold.
The suspect, an unidentified white male, is seen approaching the victim and reportedly asking him for money.
Philpot's grieving friend, Caleb Shuey, who arrived at the scene minutes after the attack, told Fox45 that his friend said he didn't have any.
The suspect is seen petting the victim's dog just moments before he launched his deadly assault.
The elderly veteran is then knocked to the ground as the suspect begins kicking him.
He then casually walks away minutes after the attack as first responders arrive at the scene.
Shuey said his friend was, 'The nicest guy on the planet. You can tell that he values life and enjoys himself.'
Several years earlier, Philpot was on the news for protecting a local postal box that criminals were stealing from.
The victim was rushed to hospital following the savage beating but tragically succumbed to his injuries early Sunday morning, his family confirmed.
Police are now desperately hunting the unnamed suspect.
In a post on X, police released photos and appealing for public assistance.
He is described as a 5'8 or 5'9 white male with dirty blond hair. He was seen wearing a white T-shirt and dark-colored shorts with a yellow striped on the sides along with white sneakers and a backpack.
They've urged anyone with information to contact investigators at 410-396-2100 or Metro Crime Stoppers at 1-866-7-LockUp.
This latest incident adds to the growing list of violent crimes plaguing Baltimore.
A report obtained by Fox45 in April shows crime surging in nearly all categories by almost 80 percent in some neighborhoods.
This includes auto theft, burglaries and aggravated assaults, according to the report.
But as of July 8, Baltimore has seen significant improvements in some areas of crime.
Despite homicides decreasing by 33.8 percent and non-fatal shootings down by 36.5 percent as compared to 2022 - juvenile crime is on the rise and has increased by 208 percent over the past three years.
