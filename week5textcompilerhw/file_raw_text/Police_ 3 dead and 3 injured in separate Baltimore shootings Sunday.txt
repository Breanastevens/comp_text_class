Multiple shootings in Baltimore on Sunday left three dead and three injured, according to police.
A triple shooting in Northwest Baltimore Sunday afternoon left one man dead, police said.
Officers were called to the 3900 block of Liberty Heights Avenue around 3:22 p.m. for a report of a shooting, Baltimore Police said in a news release.
Once there, police found three men with gunshot wounds. Two of the victims were transported to hospitals where they were treated and listed in stable condition, police said. A third man was pronounced dead at the scene by medics.
Earlier Sunday, one person died in a double shooting and another was killed overnight separately in Baltimore, police said.
Police responded to the 400 block of Washburn Avenue in South Baltimore's Brooklyn neighborhood for the report of a shooting around 8:45 a.m., according to a news release from Baltimore Police.
Upon arrival, officers located two men suffering from gunshot wounds in a vehicle. Both men, aged 45 and 35, were transported to a hospital, where the 45-year-old was pronounced dead, the release says.
Around 12:09 a.m. the night before, medics responded to the 3700 block of East Baltimore Street in the Baltimore Highlands in East Baltimore for a report of an unresponsive man, police said.
According to the release, the 44-year-old was transported to Bayview Hospital for treatment, where he was later pronounced dead. Police said the victim "showed signs of trauma," which prompted a homicide investigation. The Medical Examiner's office ruled his death to be a homicide, police said Monday.
As of Monday afternoon, there were eight homicide investigations this year in Baltimore, according to police.
Anyone with information about any of the shootings is asked to contact homicide detectives at 410-396-2100. Anonymous tips may be made to Metro Crime Stoppers at 1-8666-7LOCKUP.
