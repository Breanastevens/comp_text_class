New data from the Baltimore City State's Attorney's office shows juvenile crime is skyrocketing across the city. In 2022, 191 juveniles faced criminal charges. In 2023, that grew to 304, and in 2024 to 590 - a 208% rise in overall juvenile crime in the past three years.
"It's terrible to see and very disconcerting," said Deputy State's Attorney Catharine Rosenblatt.
Some of the top offenses, car thefts and carjackings, were driven up 158%, and robberies saw an alarming 1,347% increase.
"We're seeing more and more violent crimes from kids at a younger and younger age,"  Rosenblatt said. "It's disheartening. I guess we have to work harder."
Just within the last week, a quiet Northeast Baltimore neighborhood was rocked by a brazen armed robbery; the suspects arrested were only 16 and 12 years old. Just a few miles south along the Pulaski Highway, a 16-year-old was arrested for a deadly hit-and-run. And to the west, at the Mondawmin Metro Center, a 14-year-old was shot and killed, along with a 19-year-old who survived the attack. On social media, police are asking the public to help identify a suspect, whose image shows another young face.
Some Baltimore City residents say they were shocked, but not surprised. "I just pray they stop killing each other,"Robert Taylor said.
"These kids today, they are dangerous. We were mischievous in my day, but these kids are dangerous," said Archie Branch, another city resident.
Many say they're holding out hope change will arrive in November. That's when Maryland's new juvenile justice reform law is scheduled to take effect, which will expand the charges those under the age of 13 can face to include sex offenses, gun violations, and cases of animal cruelty.
