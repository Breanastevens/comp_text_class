The following information was released by the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland:
Today,U.S. District Judge Deborah K. Chasanow sentenced Montreal Proctor, 34, of Baltimore, Maryland, to three years in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release, for federal charges of illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition.
Erek L. Barron, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, announced the sentence with Special Agent in Charge Toni M. Crosby, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and Commissioner Richard Worley, Baltimore Police Department (BPD).
According to his guilty plea, on June 30, 2022, Proctor walked through the 500 block of Chateau Avenue, in Baltimore, while armed with a loaded firearm. While walking, Proctor encountered police officers as they were patrolling the area. He then took a loaded firearm from out of his waistband, resulting in a brief standoff. Proctor eventually dropped the firearm and began to flee before he was later arrested.
Law enforcement recovered the firearm and found that it was a Ruger .40 caliber pistol that was loaded with more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Proctor was previously convicted of several violent offenses, including attempted murder, first-degree assault, and attempted robbery. In addition to his federal sentence, Proctor is facing state charges for violating probation.
This case is part of Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), a program bringing together all levels of law enforcement and the communities they serve to reduce violent crime and make our neighborhoods safer for everyone. PSN, an evidence-based program proven to be effective at reducing violent crime, is the centerpiece of the Department of Justice's violent crime reduction efforts. Through PSN, a broad spectrum of stakeholders work together to identify the most pressing violent crime problems in the community and develop comprehensive solutions to address them. As part of this strategy, PSN focuses enforcement efforts on the most violent offenders and partners with locally based prevention and reentry programs for lasting reductions in crime.
U.S. Attorney Barron commended the ATF and BPD for their work in the investigation. Mr. Barron also thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jason D. Medinger and Adeyemi Adenrele, who prosecuted the case.
