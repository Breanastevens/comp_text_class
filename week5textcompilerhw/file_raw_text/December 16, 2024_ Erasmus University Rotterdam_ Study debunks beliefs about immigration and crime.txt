A comprehensive study by economists Prof. Olivier Marie (Erasmus School of Economics) and Prof. Paolo Pinotti
Opens external (Bocconi University) reveals that fears about rising crime due to immigration are largely unfounded.
The study
Opens external, published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, combines an extensive review of the existing literature with new evidence to examine the relationship between immigration and criminal activity across multiple countries. While public opinion surveys in OECD countries reveal significant concerns about a perceived link between immigration and crime, empirical evidence paints a different picture. Immigration does not lead to higher crime rates
Using data from 55 countries over three decades, the study first shows no correlation between higher immigration rates and increased crime levels. Homicide rates, for instance, decreased by one-third globally from 1990 to 2019, even as the share of immigrants in the population grew by two-thirds.
These findings remain consistent across multiple studies reviewed, which use innovative methodologies to test whether immigrant inflows causally increase crime rates in various countries. This is further supported by the authors' own analysis of novel data, comparing 215 regions across European countries, which also reveals no causal link between immigration and crime.
