During the first federal consent decree hearing of 2025, Judge James Bredar approved a joint motion for compliance within three sections of the consent decree.
Baltimore City, which is entering its eighth year under federal monitoring, has reached full and effective compliance within five sections of the federal consent decree.
The approved sections include:
First Amendment Protected Activities
Coordination with City Schools Police
Community Oversight Task Force
Sections approved in January 2024 included "Transportation of Persons in Custody," and 'Officer Assistance and Support.' 
In 2017, the City of Baltimore was placed under the federal consent decree after an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice revealed a pattern of unconstitutional policing.
That investigation was prompted by the Freddie Gray case, the 25-year-old who died while in police custody in April 2015 and whose death sparked protests and unrest throughout the city.
"The Transportation of Persons in Custody" was a significant milestone, leaders said, because it's ultimately what led to the federal consent decree.
Prosecutors argued Gray died of injuries he sustained while being transported by police and his case prompted the DOJ's investigation.
"We've got five out of the 17 which is almost 30% so we can now see the finish line," said Police Commissioner Richard Worley, following the first half of Thursday's hearing. "We're not going to revert back to anything we've done in the past if we've made changes, positive changes and we've shown that you can both reform a police department and lower violent crime at the same time."
Items remaining on the consent decree include staffing.
Bredar acknowledged the police department increased its number of officers hired from 110 in 2023 to 163 in 2024. Still, the department continues to lose more officers than it hired. BPD confirmed 185 officers left the department in 2024, a loss of about two dozen.
"It's always concerning, but we can't worry about it as much," said Worley, when asked about staffing. "We have a job to do every single day. Even if we hired 100 officers today they still wouldn't be on the street for seven months. Our men and women have shown we can do more with less and we'll continue to do that. I'm really encouraged because our last class had 50 BPD officers."
Sections approved for compliance must sustain compliance for one year.
"Transportation of Persons in Custody" and "Officer Assistance and Support" were approved on Jan 26, 2024, nearing the one-year mark.
The city must apply to have the sections officially removed from the consent decree.
