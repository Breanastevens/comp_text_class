After a two-week trial, a federal jury found Jalen Thomas Kelley, 22, Abingdon, Maryland,guilty of aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, and assault within the territorial jurisdiction.
Erek L. Barron, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland announced the verdict with Special Agent in Charge William J. DelBagno, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Baltimore Field Office.
"Sexual violence is a horrific violation of personal autonomy and will not be tolerated. We will hold perpetrators accountable," said U.S. Attorney Barron. "This verdict should send a message to survivors that they are heard, validated and supported."
According to the evidence presented at trial, between January 1, and January 2, 2023, the defendant forcibly raped and assaulted the victim, who was a minor at the time, aboard the Carnival Legend. The cruise vessel was scheduled to return to Baltimore on January 2.In addition to the charged offenses, during trial, prosecutors presented testimony from six other individuals who alleged Kelley sexually assaulted them on separate occasions. Kelley faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. A federal district court judge will determine the sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
"We will never stop working to serve justice for the victims of predators like Mr. Kelley, no matter where the crime occurs," said FBI Baltimore DelBagno said. "Today's conviction reflects the unwavering resolve of the FBI to protect our communities and keep Americans safe."
This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse.
