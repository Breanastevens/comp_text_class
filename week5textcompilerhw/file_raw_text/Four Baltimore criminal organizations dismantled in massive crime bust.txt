Maryland law enforcement officials said this week they have dismantled four violent criminal organizations that have been dealing weapons and drugs in Baltimore.
Almost 40 people have been criminally charged so far while dozens of illegal guns, 15 stolen vehicles, and a large cache of narcotics and money were recovered in a collaborative effort among more than a dozen local, state and federal law enforcement agencies that officials called Operation Tornado Alley.
With other suspects at large, additional arrests and charges are expected, officials say.
The four criminal organizations worked primarily in southwest Baltimore while trafficking narcotics, the citys states attorney, Ivan Bates, said at a news conference Monday. He announced the indictments alongside Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D), U.S. Attorney Erek Barron, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D), city Police Commissioner Richard Worley and Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Maryland).
They were joined by special agents in charge of the regions Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives field offices, as well as the Baltimore city officials who work on restorative efforts in crime-affected communities.
Its all of us working together, constantly talking, Bates said of the many entities involved in the year-long investigation. What were all able to bring is that connection that was missing.
Operation Tornado Alley began as a Baltimore Police Department investigation, part of the citys Group Violence Reduction Strategy that combines targeted law enforcement investigations and city-sponsored intervention resources to those most likely to be involved in violence.
The bulk of the arrests happened Nov. 19, when, in the middle of the night, Baltimore police carried out 16 search and seizure warrants targeting three locations a sprawling effort that involved neighboring local law enforcement agencies, the Maryland State Police, Baltimore city fire and animal control officials, and federal help from the DEA, ATF and FBI.
The raids were aided by wiretapping the telephones of those allegedly involved in the criminal organizations, a resource hurdle that Bates was able to clear with the help of Barron, the U.S. attorney, who corralled federal resources to fund the months-long effort.
When the feds step down from our ivory tower, we are at our best, Barron said at the news conference.
The result, Bates said, was the recovery of large amounts of cocaine, heroin, fentanyl and cannabis and more than $373,000 that police think are narcotics sales proceeds. Authorities also said they seized 15 stolen vehicles and 65 firearms, including illegal ghost guns and weapons fitted with machine gun conversion devices.
Toni Crosby, the special agent in charge of ATFs Baltimore Field Division, said the seized guns have been linked through the national ballistics database to 47 shooting investigations.
These devices pose a massive threat to public safety, Crosby said at the news conference while standing near three rectangular tables that served as a display for the weapons and bags of drugs.
The wiretaps allowed federal officials to intervene in numerous incidents of violence before they happened, authorities said, including a planned armed robbery, an escalating turf war and a premeditated hit.
Bates called the operation a significant step forward to protecting Baltimore neighborhoods.
Moore touted the effort as an example of his administrations intent to prioritize public safety and encourage coordination. He praised Baltimores precipitous drop in violent crime and said that this hasnt happened by accident.
In Maryland, Moore said, we have chosen to work together.
