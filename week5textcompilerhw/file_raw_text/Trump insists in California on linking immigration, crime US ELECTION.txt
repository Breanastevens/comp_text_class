Los Angeles, United States, Oct 12 (EFE).- Former United States President and Republican candidate Donald Trump again linked crime and illegal immigration to mobilize conservatives in California, a state with a Democratic majority, to maintain control of the House of Representatives in November.
Trump appeared in Coachella, a city east of Los Angeles known for the eponymous festival, as a headliner to talk about what he called an "immigrant invasion," adding that if he wins the elections on Nov. 5 it will be "the day of liberation."
The former president again used transnational gang Tren de Aragua to draw a direct link between illegal immigration and crime in the country, something not supported by data, which show the crime rate among immigrants is lower than in the rest of the population.
"California has been invaded. Beautiful girls are being cut into pieces," said the former president, adding he hopes the fear of illegal immigration, which soared in the first years of President Joe Biden's administration, will help him win the November elections.
Trump promised the death penalty for any immigrant who kills an American citizen or a police officer.
The Republican said he would use a 1798 law against foreign enemies of the US to obtain the authority to deport en masse immigrants who have entered the country illegally in what he has dubbed "Operation Aurora." This is in reference to the Colorado city that became a media hotspot for the alleged presence of the Tren de Aragua.
Local leaders in Colorado have denied this narrative about immigrant criminality, including Aurora's Republican Mayor Mike Coffman, who said this week that "concerns about Venezuelan gang activity have been grossly exaggerated."
Police departments in several cities across the country have detected activity that they have linked to the Tren de Aragua, an organization born in a prison near Caracas and that has been accused of crimes such as extortion and sexual exploitation of migrants in South America.
However, Trump and the ultra-conservative information ecosystem have magnified this type of news and taken out of context data on undocumented immigrants with criminal records or histories to stigmatize immigrants.
California is key for Republicans to maintain control of the lower house of congress, since there are between five and six highly contested seats at stake in the state.
The California Democratic congressman and president of the Democratic Caucus, the highest-ranking Latino in Congress, Pete Aguilar, told EFE they are "very optimistic that the majority of the House will be won in California. I have worked hard on these political efforts to win these seats."
Coachella Mayor Steven Hernandez has insisted that the Coachella Valley is not receptive to Trump's ideas.
"He has not been invited by the people who live here," he said this week about the former Republican president's visit. EFE
