Baltimore County's overall crime rate remained nearly unchanged last year, compared to 2023, even as the community saw its lowest homicide rate in a decade, along with sharp drops in forcible rapes and building thefts over the last 12 months, according to year-end government figures.
The number of homicides edged down slightly: The county recorded 28 such deaths in 2024, compared with 29 the prior year. Meanwhile, the number of shoplifting and arson cases increased.
Baltimore County Second District Councilman Israel "Izzy" Patoka sees the year-end figures as a positive. He lauded Baltimore County Police Chief Robert O. McCullough and pointed to the strong relationship between the communities and police in helping drive down crime.
"I absolutely see strides being made in terms of crime, [which] seems to be trending in the right direction," Patoka said. "I do think it's really important we realize that this is a snapshot in time and that we have to remain vigilant 
on the community side. The police have to remain vigilant because you never want that graph to turn in a direction that has a poor trajectory.
"That trajectory is pretty decent right now and we want to keep it heading that way."
While Baltimore City saw much sharper drops in reported lawbreaking, including a 23% drop in homicides, the data show that the higher-population county continues to have a far lower rate of crime. But the community has seen some recent high-profile crimes, including a mass shooting last month in the Towson area. And some residents say they feel less safe.
"I've been a business owner here, right at the circle, for four years now, and I have noticed over the past two years, there just appears to be a lot more crime," said Michael Dent, owner of Touch Free Wellness on Allegheny Avenue in Towson. "Most of it seems to be happening in the Towson mall.  A lot of crime also seems to be happening in smaller convenience stores. We are a service-oriented business, but I hear about a lot of crime in the news. It's very scary. I get concerned. It's definitely worrisome."
According to a Baltimore County police spokesperson, there were 28 homicides last year, one fewer than in 2023 and six fewer than in 2022. That translates into 3.3 per 100,000 residents.
This contrasts with Baltimore City's sharp decline in homicides over the past 12 months. The Baltimore Police Department recorded 201 homicides in 2024, compared to 261 homicides recorded in 2023. Even so, that is a rate of 46.2 per 100,000 residents.
In addition, the Baltimore County Police Department has cleared 75% of its homicide cases as of Dec. 26 - far exceeding national clearance rates, which average approximately 50% as of 2020. The department's clearance rate in nonfatal shootings is 71%.
"The Department continues to take a data-driven approach, which enables precinct commanders the ability to identify crime patterns and implement appropriate countermeasures," Joy Lepola-Stewart, Baltimore County Police spokesperson, said. "Our business and community partners also play a crucial role in preventing and reporting crime across the county."
The Department also credits using the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network, a database of ballistics images, in improving its ability to solve gun-related crimes. The system can assist in identifying suspects and connecting crimes in which the same firearm was used. As of Dec. 16, the department has seen a 57% increase in leads from this network over the previous year. In 2023, Baltimore County police received 298 leads; that number increased to 355 in 2024.
One significant difficulty for police: Ghost guns, untraceable weapons often home assembled from pieces purchased separately. As of Dec. 16, 192 ghost guns had been recovered in Baltimore County, compared to 122 such weapons seized during the same period in 2023 - a 57% increase.
"Ghost guns continue to present a challenge," Lepola-Stewart said. "Since ghost guns circumvent background checks, they are favored by criminals and those prohibited from owning a firearm. Minors also have greater ease in obtaining a ghost gun."
By the numbers
Baltimore County saw an overall improvement in crime numbers over the last year. Total violent crime - comprising homicide, aggravated assault, robbery and forcible rape - fell 2.6% year over year, with about 320 offenses for every 100,000 residents.
However, a more complicated picture emerges when digging into the data:
The number of rapes were down by over a third, with 98 recorded in 2024;
Arsons rose 25% from 103 incidents to 129;
Assaults of any kind - comprising simple assaults, or a threat or attempt to injure someone, as well as aggravated assaults, or an attack to inflict severe or aggravated injury - changed little year over year.
Total property crime, comprising burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson, while steady with 2023, increased 32% over 2022 and 52% from 2021, with about 2,600 offenses for every 100,000 residents. Here's a further breakdown:
Shoplifting increased 17%, from 7,122 cases in 2023 to 8,366 in 2024;
While auto thefts were down 15%, an average of 10 cars were stolen a day during 2024, almost six more than the rate in 2022;
Larceny rose 4% to 17,200 compared to 16,533 in 2023 but was up 23% over 2022 (13,983 offenses);
Thefts from homes and businesses were down 21%.
Lepola-Stewart said the increase in arsons between 2023 and 2024 is "notable," but not inconsistent with the numbers from previous years. The number of incidents is small enough that even small increases translate into large percentage changes, Lepola-Stewart said.
In Towson, the Department continues to work with retailers and the Towson Chamber of Commerce to encourage more businesses to invest in surveillance cameras. Currently, 90% of businesses in Central Towson are equipped with cameras that provide the department greater access to recorded footage.
"There has been a national increase in retail theft," Lepola-Stewart said. "While a number of factors are viewed as contributing to the increase, such as the economy and online marketplaces, Baltimore County is actively working with retailers on security measures.
Patoka said one of the biggest ongoing problems is with speeding vehicles through neighborhoods. One solution is more speed cameras, but the county needs legislation to add more equipment, according to Patoka.
"I go to community meetings six or seven nights a week, and it doesn't matter if I'm in Woodlawn, Ruxton, or I am up in the valleys or Reisterstown or Owings Mills, the No. 1 issue far and away that community leaders are concerned about is speeding," Patoka said. "Drivers in Baltimore have been very disrespectful to neighborhoods."
Juvenile crime is one of the biggest concerns among residents.
"This has been going on far too long, and DJS has not done a good job holding them accountable," Timonium resident Rhonda Fonte said. "It seems there's more sympathy for the perpetrators than the victims. Our society is in a bad place right now."
