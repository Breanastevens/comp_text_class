The following information was released by the office of the Mayor of Baltimore:
Mayor's Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement (MONSE) and community-based service providers to hold series of events throughout October to spread awareness and support survivors.
BALTIMORE, MD (Tuesday, October 1, 2024) - Today, the Scott Administration, the Mayor's Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement (MONSE), and community-based service providers announced the start of Domestic Violence Awareness Month (DVAM) in Baltimore City. A kickoff block party will be held today from 4:00-7:00 p.m. at Frank C. Bocek Park, 3198 E. Madison Street, Baltimore, MD 21205. The event will feature a fashion show, community walk, intimate partner violence (IPV) prevention resources, and more.
Established nationwide in October 1987, Domestic Violence Awareness Month raises awareness for domestic violence issues, victims, and survivors and encourages networks for change. DVAM 2024 marks the 30th anniversary since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a landmark piece of legislation designed to address domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, and other forms of gender-based violence, in 1994.
In support of Domestic Violence Awareness Month and advocates, bystanders, first-responders, friends, and family who are creating change, Mayor Scott has ordered that the City Hall Dome be illuminated purple throughout the month of October.
"On behalf of the City of Baltimore, we are proud to recognize October as Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Addressing intimate partner violence is a core part of the work we are doing to reduce violent crime as part of our comprehensive public safety strategy," said Mayor Brandon M. Scott. "Our efforts would not be possible without our community-based partners, nonprofit organizations, and residents all doing their part to help end domestic violence and support survivors across Baltimore."
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, intimate partner violence impacts millions of people annually, including an estimated 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men across the country.
"To truly address intimate partner violence, we must support survivors, make systems-level change, and intervene with those who have caused harm to prevent future violence," said MONSE Director Stefanie Mavronis. "Domestic Violence Awareness Month is about taking a stand together, renewing our commitment to life-saving coordination across agencies and community-based providers, and promoting healthy, respectful, and nonviolent relationships."
This year alone, intimate partner violence has accounted for 19 percent of all violent crime in Baltimore City and as much as 44 percent in neighborhoods disproportionately impacted by poverty. Reducing incidents of intimate partner violence is a key focus of the Mayor's Comprehensive Violence Prevention Plan. The Scott Administration has focused support on trauma-informed service providers, training, and strategies that remove the sole responsibility of safety from the shoulders of victims to include abuse intervention programming designed to facilitate changed behavior and accountability in perpetrators of IPV. Through intentional and targeted prevention and intervention efforts, those at risk, including teens and young adults, as well as marginalized and underserved communities, have been prioritized.
In addition to added programming, MONSE has built out an Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Prevention team within the agency's Victim Services lane. MONSE's IPV Prevention team regularly holds prevention workshops to raise awareness on the signs of healthy and unhealthy relationships in partnership with schools, the LGBTQIA+ community, faith-based ministries and teen-focused groups. The agency also offers direct service assistance, crisis intervention, and court accompaniment for victims seeking protective orders.
In 2023, MONSE, through the Baltimore City Visitation Center, facilitated nearly 650 supervised visits and monitored exchange services for 73 families without incident and assisted 100 young people in families working to overcome domestic abuse. Since expanding to weekly instead of biweekly visitation services in 2022 thanks to Mayor Scott's ARPA investment into public safety, the Visitation Center has increased its service capacity by nearly 85% and overall referrals from all sources by 17%.
