The Council on American-Islamic Relations issued the following news release on June 28, 2024:
The Maryland office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today condemned neo-Nazi vandalism near Jewish homes in Baltimore.
According to reports, Nazi swastikas were "spray painted on a street with several Jewish families" in the Glen neighborhood.
"We condemn this hate vandalism as a betrayal of the values of inclusivity and tolerance in our community," said CAIR Maryland Director Zainab Chaudry. "Protecting religious pluralism requires denouncing hatred, erasure and bigotry wherever it exists."
She added that CAIR and the American Muslim community stand in solidarity with all those challenging Islamophobia, antisemitism, anti-Palestinian hate, systemic anti-Black racism, xenophobia, white supremacy, and all other forms of bigotry.

CAIR is America's largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization. Its mission is to enhance understanding of Islam, protect civil rights, promote justice, and empower American Muslims.
