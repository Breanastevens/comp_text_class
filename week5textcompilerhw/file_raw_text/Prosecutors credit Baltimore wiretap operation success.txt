The partnership between federal and local leaders has been on full display recently, especially with the news of the largest takedown in recent years resulting in indictments connected to four criminal drug trafficking organizations. And the two top prosecutors say their teamwork is here to stay.
Baltimore City State's Attorney Ivan Bates and U.S. Attorney for Maryland Erek Barron said their united front is not just for appearances. They noted the six-month wiretap investigation leading to 39 state indictments involving four different crime rings didn't just materialize from nothing.
"Things like this didn't happen before because there was no partnership," Bates said. "Having that partnership - I don't have the relationship with some of the federal partners that the U.S. Attorney does."
When asked why he wanted to take this case, Barron said he believed his office should take a leadership role in the crime-fighting strategy. That means stepping up when necessary, he said.
"Problem-solving is about, sometimes it's about being innovative - you know - Al Capone model of prosecuting, right? But sometimes it's simply about caring," Barron said. "I care to the point where it could be my daughter who's the next victim, that's how much I care. That's how much the public expects the state's attorney and I to care. That's how much they deserve us to work at this."
In August 2022, Barron spoke at a news conference with other state and local leaders, including Baltimore City Mayor Brandon Scott and then-Gov. Larry Hogan. During that event, Barron launched his "Al Capone" style of prosecution plans. He said his office planned to use any legal means necessary to ensure criminals face accountability.
"We started seeing historical reductions in violent crime" after that news conference, Barron said.
Homicides have declined in Baltimore City; 2023 ended with fewer than 300 homicides for the first time since 2014, marking a 21% drop from the previous year. So far, the city is on track to close out 2024 with fewer than 300 homicides again.
Bates said the partnership with the U.S. Attorney's Office continues to grow, and Barron said his experience working as a local prosecutor helped prepare him for the challenges that can arise and helped him understand how a federal partner can help.
"I was an assistant state's attorney for Baltimore City, so I know what that looks like on the ground. I know the power of our office to help that individual assistant state's attorney," Barron said. "So, knowing that, allows me to move in a different way than someone else might."
