A 19-year-old from Baltimore was sentenced Friday to 50 years in prison for fatally shooting Fabian Alberto Sanchez Gonzalez in 2023 at a T-Mobile store in Canton at the end of what prosecutors described as a "crime spree."
Baltimore Circuit Judge Robert K. Taylor Jr. handed down a life sentence to Arthur McCaden, suspending all but 50 years of incarceration.
"He is unable to follow any laws or rules," Taylor said of the defendant, adding that "no one is safe" if he were to be released today.
People convicted of crimes of violence in Maryland become eligible for parole after serving half of their punishment, meaning McCaden would first become eligible after 25 years in prison.
McCaden pleaded guilty in May to first-degree murder, attempted and actual armed robbery, and use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence.
Authorities say McCaden shot Gonzalez, who worked at the store on Boston Street, during a robbery on April 30, 2023. McCaden and his younger brother, 14 at the time, apparently went on a string of stickups stretching to New Jersey.
McCaden also pleaded guilty to armed robbery charges related to robberies at two other T-Mobile stores in Baltimore and of two people at a Metro SubwayLink stop near a T-Mobile store. It's unclear what happened to his younger brother's cases, as he was prosecuted in juvenile court, where records are shielded. Taylor's sentence encompassed the robbery cases.
"Each of these cases had at least one victim. The defendant went on a crime spree," Assistant State's Attorney Justin Greer told Taylor. He added that McCaden's "actions were cold-hearted and calculated."
Baltimore Police officers responded around 4:30 p.m. April 30, 2023, to the T-Mobile store in Canton for reports of a shooting, according to charging documents. They found Gonzalez sitting in a chair, complaining of chest pain from a gunshot wound. Baltimore City Fire Department medics took Gonzalez to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, where he later died.
In a letter read aloud in court by her son, Carlos Sanchez, Gonzalez's mother said she couldn't get the image of her son in the hospital out of her head. His parents visit their son's grave every day.
"I can't even explain the amount of pain this has caused my family," Sanchez said, reading aloud his own letter to the judge.
Relatives described Gonzalez as a "hardworking boy with a big, kind heart." They said he helped to provide for his family and had no vices. They added that he despised violence and argument.
Gonzalez graduated from Cristo Rey Jesuit High School and St. Ignatius Loyola Academy. The Southeast Baltimore community remembered him as a young man who touched many lives.
At the store, crime scene technicians collected a single 9mm cartridge casing, according to charging documents. Detectives, meanwhile, reviewed security camera footage of the robbery, taking stills picturing two assailants and distributing those images to law enforcement with hopes someone could identify them.
Prosecutors played a montage of security footage from McCaden's robbery spree at sentencing. In each case, McCaden walked up to the counter of the store, pulled a handgun out of his pocket and pointed it at an employee.
In footage of the Canton robbery, McCaden, clad in a blue jumpsuit, is seen pointing a gun at Gonzalez before firing one shot.
Charging documents say a Baltimore County Police robbery detective told city investigators he recognized one of the assailants from the stills as McCaden. He was wearing a blue tracksuit and someone with the Department of Juvenile Services also identified McCaden from the footage.
Baltimore Police arrested McCaden, who was 18 at the time, and his brother on May 5, 2023 - about five days after Gonzalez was gunned down.
Defense attorney Maura L. Lynch said her presentation in court Friday was "no excuse" for what her client did but context about what led him to this point.
Lynch said her client had an IQ of 64 and had been deemed intellectually disabled. She said he couldn't read or write, and that he was incarcerated in juvenile justice facilities for much of his childhood. She also said McCaden suffered from mental illness that yielded hallucinations and that he had a history of taking drugs.
After prosecutors said McCaden had no remorse for his crimes, Lynch countered, "One of the huge consequences of an IQ this low is a lack of empathy."
"I just want to say I apologize to the victim's family," McCaden said in court, adding that he struggled throughout childhood without a father figure in his life.
McCaden's father was in and out of jail for much of his life. The older Arthur McCaden is currently serving life in prison for murder.
Despite all of his time in juvenile custody, McCaden never received services, according to Lynch.
"The system absolutely failed him," Taylor said.
But the judge said he was troubled that McCaden had, by his tally, been arrested 45 times since he was 12 and had numerous infractions while incarcerated. He had only been released from custody three days before shooting Gonzalez.
"He was violent at school. He was violent on the streets. He was violent in jail," Taylor said.
Taylor said he was recommending McCaden for the Patuxent Youthful Offenders Program, which provides extra services to people who committed crimes when they were young, with hopes of better preparing them to return to society.
