Violent crime fell in Baltimore City and across the state last year, with the city recording its lowest number of homicides since 2011.
There were 201 homicides in the city in 2024, according to the Baltimore Police Department, a significant drop from the 262 homicides in 2023. Last year’s figure represented a 40.5% drop from the 338 homicides in the city in 2021.
“I am deeply proud of this progress,” Mayor Brandon Scott said in a news release, “but it will never be enough until no single Baltimorean loses their life to gun violence  and we will continue working towards that goal every single day. ”
The city’s reduction in homicides was just one data point leaders celebrated.
According to the Maryland U.S. Attorney’s Office, nonfatal shootings in Baltimore also fell for the third year in a row.
There were 414 nonfatal shootings last year, compared to 635 in 2023. There was an even steeper drop in juvenile victims of homicides and nonfatal shootings  74%  from 2023 to 2024, according to BPD.
“We know very well that there is much more work to be done in building trust with our communities,” Baltimore Police Commissioner Richard Worley stated. “We plan to build on these successes in partnership with all our stakeholders and community partners. ”

Scott highlighted the Comprehensive Violence Prevention Plan he implemented in 2021, which aims to bring a public-health approach to violence prevention. He also highlighted his Group Violence Reduction Strategy, which, according to his first-term report, “facilitates direct, sustained engagement with a small number of group-involved individuals who are the most likely to be the victim or perpetrator of violence.
“The progress we have seen with public safety is about more than just numbers, they are lives saved, families who do not have to live the rest of their lives with the trauma of losing a loved one, and people who do not have to deal with the lifelong pain of being a victim of gun violence,” Scott stated in his first-term report.
Statewide, homicides dropped by 31% from 659 in 2021 to 455 in 2024, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Violent crime as a whole dropped by a similar percentage.
Furthermore, the rate of people being held in federal prisons before trial decreased by 40% from 2018 to last year, reducing what Maryland U.S. Attorney Erek Barron called “costly and unnecessary incarceration. ”
“We will continue to be a force-multiplier for the work of our various Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies, and community-based partners,” Barron stated.
