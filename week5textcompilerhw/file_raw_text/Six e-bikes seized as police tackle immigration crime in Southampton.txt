A police spokesperson said: "The proactive, multi-agency operation was launched primarily to assist us in identifying and safeguarding those who are being exploited by immigration crime and modern slavery, as well as targeting those committing offences.
"The operation also focused on those travelling on e-bikes, e-scooters and mopeds that were not road-worthy in support of our ongoing road safety work.
"Throughout the course of the evening more than 20 people were stopped and spoken to by officers, with nine immigration checks being carried out by Immigration Enforcement colleagues and three people dealt with for immigration-related offences.
"Six e-bikes were seized for not being road-worthy and a number of traffic offences were also dealt with."

Southampton West Inspector Andy Proctor added: "This was a proactive intelligence-led operation to assist us in tackling the incredibly complex issue of modern slavery, exploitation and organised immigration crime, specifically focused on the food industry, on the streets of Shirley.
-We know that organised crime groups are exploiting individuals in this sector and that some victims are trapped in a cycle of this exploitation and modern day slavery.
"We also know that there are people engaging in work voluntarily while knowingly committing offences in contravention of the Immigration Act and Road Traffic Act, placing our communities at risk.
"Shirley High Street and the surrounding area is a hub of activity and the roads can get very busy and easily congested.
"It-s important that we are tackling any traffic offences that could put other road users at risk proactively and efficiently, ensuring that those working within the food industry and the vehicles used are compliant with the Road Traffic Act and not putting anyone at risk.
"Modern Day Slavery is closer than you think - information from our communities is key in identifying criminal activity connected to organised crime and modern day slavery.
"We would continue to encourage anyone who notices suspicious activity or a vulnerable person who seems to be working against their will to contact us.-
