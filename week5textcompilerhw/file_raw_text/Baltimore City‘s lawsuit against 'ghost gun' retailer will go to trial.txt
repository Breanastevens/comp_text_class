Baltimore City’s lawsuit against an Anne Arundel County-based “ghost gun” retailer will proceed to trial after a city judge last week rejected the retailer’s request to dismiss the case.
City Circuit Judge Shannon Avery rejected Hanover Armory’s motion for summary judgment at a hearing Oct. 15, saying there were “disputes as to material facts” about the company’s liability for crime in Baltimore.
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott celebrated Avery’s ruling as a win for the city, which argued the retailers “flooded” the city with weapons that were difficult to trace, targeting buyers who were not legally allowed to own firearms but could still buy ghost guns without background checks.
“During this administration, we have always taken a comprehensive approach to reducing gun violence in Baltimore  which means holding accountable everyone from those who pull the trigger to those who help supply the weapons,” Scott said in a statement.

The city sued the nation’s leading ghost gun manufacturer, Polymer80, and retailer Hanover Armory on June 1, 2022, the same day Maryland’s ban on ghost guns took effect.
Those guns, which retailers refer to as privately made firearms, or PMFs, are purchased in kits and assembled by the buyer. They lack serial numbers and are not subject to background checks, making them difficult to trace.
“In making these sales, Hanover Armory does not seek to determine whether a purchaser is a domestic abuser, felon, juvenile, or any other kind of prohibited purchaser,” the city’s law department, which brought the case along with Brady United Against Gun Violence and Sanford Heisler Sharp, wrote in its complaint.
“By manufacturing and selling ghost guns, these Defendants have predictably, if not intentionally, caused violence, destruction, and death in Baltimore City. ”
The lawsuit said Baltimore police recovered a skyrocketing number of ghost guns, from nine in 2018 to 324 in 2021, representing 14% of the firearms it seized. It recovered 131 in the first four months of 2022.
Hanover Armory argued the plaintiffs couldn’t prove its “privately-made firearms” contributed to any specific crime in Baltimore. It said the city overstated its market share, relied on inaccurate lists and didn’t account for online purchases.
“(Baltimore) has had a longstanding, pre-PMF problem with gun violence going back decades before Hanover even existed,” the company’s motion for summary judgment stated.

“Now that the City has recently been recovering more PMFs than in prior years though, it is looking for a scapegoat for its problems with gun violence, and it has apparently chosen Hanover. But there is no evidence (literally none) that any PMF used to commit a crime in Baltimore was ever sold by or in any way connected to Hanover. ”
The company’s settlement talks were unproductive. Its trial in Baltimore City Circuit Court is scheduled to begin Dec. 3.
Polymer80 in February reached a settlement with the city and exited the lawsuit. It agreed to pay $1.2 million, stop advertising in Maryland and stop selling ghost guns to Marylanders, according to a city news release. It was also required to stop retailers in nearby states from selling to Maryland residents, and to give the city quarterly reports on sales of ghost guns in neighboring states.
Polymer80 has since gone out of business due to lawsuits. It also settled cases in Philadelphia and Los Angeles, according to The Trace, agreeing to end sales in California and much of Pennsylvania. A Washington, D.C., judge ordered it to pay $4 million and to stop doing business there.
Soon after Maryland’s ban took effect in June, the Biden administration issued a rule requiring gun assembly kits to include serial numbers and for sellers to conduct background checks on buyers. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments earlier this month in a case challenging that rule.
