The newest bar venture from Atlas Restaurant Group, The Undefeated, is now open in Fells Point, about six months after coming to an agreement with neighbors who initially opposed the project.
"We're excited to further invest in Fells Point, a landmark neighborhood that is so important to Baltimore's history and culture," Alex Smith, president of Atlas Restaurant Group, said in an email. "With The Undefeated, we're introducing something new to the area - a craft cocktail experience with Cuban influences and an island vibe."
The Undefeated, a 40-seat, Key West-inspired cocktail bar on the 1700 block of Thames Street, offers signature cocktails incorporating "the flavors of Key West and its Cuban influences," per a news release from Atlas, in addition to classic tropical cocktails such as mai tais and mojitos. Smith cited a "completely refreshed courtyard" for use in spring and summer.
The bar is situated next to the Waterfront Hotel, an Atlas property that some neighbors had complained was too loud when they initially opposed expanding its liquor license to its courtyard area this past summer.
The bar and surrounding community eventually reached an agreement limiting noise and capacity in that section.
Smith and his brother Eric Smith, an Atlas co-owner, are nephews of Baltimore Sun co-owner David D. Smith, who is a partner in some Atlas restaurants.
Several restaurants in the Fells Point neighborhood have recently closed, citing high prices and a perception of crime, though crime is down in Baltimore.
