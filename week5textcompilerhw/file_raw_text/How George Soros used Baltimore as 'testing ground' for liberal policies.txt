President Joe Biden awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom this month to George Soros, a billionaire philanthropist who spent tens of millions of dollars in Baltimore to establish a "testing ground" for liberal policies.
Baltimore hosted Soros' only local field office for his Open Society philanthropic empire from 1998 to 2023. The office, commonly called the Open Society Institute (OSI), bankrolled Baltimore nonprofits for decades. The organization was tied directly to Baltimore City Mayor Brandon Scott and Baltimore City Council President Zeke Cohen.
Aryeh Neier, the president emeritus of Open Society Foundations, emphasized in 2023 how OSI enacted revolutionary ideas on criminal justice reform, drug harm reduction and education policy in Baltimore.
"A defining feature of George Soros's philanthropy since he launched his first national foundation in Hungary in 1984 is that, to a greater extent than any other foundation, its activities were guided by local knowledge," Neier wrote on the Open Society Foundations website. "That philosophy helped drive the decision to open an office in Baltimore in 1998, as a testing ground to address critical urban issues."
"We chose Baltimore mainly because we thought it epitomized the urban problems we wanted to address," Neier continued. "The city suffered from economic problems that reflected a substantial decline in population caused largely by 'white flight' from the city: a high level of drug addiction; a severe crime problem; and a public education system plagued by student and teacher absenteeism and by suspensions and expulsions from the schools."
But Baltimore's struggles with drugs, crime and education persisted amid OSI's advocacy. OSI, which filed nonprofit tax forms as the Alliance for Open Society International, has spent nearly $2 million since 2016 on two drug harm reduction groups in Baltimore: Charm City Care Connection and Baltimore Harm Reduction Coalition, as previously reported by Spotlight on Maryland. The groups work to distribute clean drug paraphernalia such as syringes and crack pipes, as well as Narcan, with a goal to reduce drug overdoses and overall stigma for drug use.
Though the fatal drug overdose rate in Baltimore was cut in half from 2000 to 2011, it steadily increased by more than 500% from 2011 to 2022, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
OSI hosted a trip in 2022 with Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, as well as other Baltimore City and Maryland state lawmakers, to visit a drug consumption site in New York City. A Spotlight on Maryland investigation found Open Society Foundations helped fund the trip through grants to the Baltimore Harm Reduction Coalition.
Scott announced in December plans to push for drug consumption sites in Baltimore. These sites allow people to use drugs at supervised sites that aim to reduce overdoses. However, longitudinal studies found drug consumption sites have no effect on overdose death rates.
The persistent increase in drug overdoses coincided with murder rates in Baltimore, which increased by 80% from 2011 to 2020. The overall violent crime rate steadily decreased by 45% from 2000 to 2014 but spiked by 51% leading up to 2017.
Criminal justice reform efforts escalated in 2015 after the death of Freddie Gray at the hands of Baltimore City police. These efforts continued in response to national outrage in 2020 over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota.
OSI capitalized on the renewed push for criminal justice reform in response to national criticism of law enforcement in 2015 and 2020. It distributed grants to a series of non-profits in Charm City focused on ways to cut police funding, decrease incarceration rates and increase community-based efforts to counter crime.
Open Society Foundations has given more than $600,000 since 2019 to the Citizen Policing Project, which published a 2022 memo titled "the Long Game: DEFUND, DIVEST, REFORM and ABOLISH." The memo details how to defund law enforcement and cites support from OSI.
Baltimore Action Legal Team has received more than $1 million from Open Society Foundations since 2017. The group hosts a "Community Bail Fund" launched in 2015 that provides financial support for criminals attempting to make bail.
The Foundation to Promote Open Society, another Soros non-profit, gave $250,000 in 2019 to the Fund for Educational Excellence to "enhance the reach, knowledge and skills of Safe Street staff to more effectively and efficiently engage the community in restoration, and enhance the effectiveness of Safe Street's violence prevention strategy," as previously reported by Spotlight on Maryland. The Safe Streets program has been plagued with controversies in recent years, including a series of FBI raids on its offices, fiscal mismanagement and the alleged use of fabricated names for staffers.
Organizing Black, which received $400,000 from Open Society Foundations since 2022, organized a gathering outside Baltimore City Hall in 2020 where it painted "Defund Police" on Gay Street.
OSI's Education and Youth Development program, dating back to 2018, gave millions to Baltimore non-profits helping address a variety of issues such as student absences, failed course rates and dropout rates. Data shows these issues have worsened in recent years.
Hundreds of students in Baltimore City Public Schools were promoted to the next grade despite missing more than 60 days of school, according to data obtained in a lawsuit by Fox45 Baltimore and The Baltimore Sun in November.
In 2022, Baltimore City had 23 schools without a single student who tested proficient in math, Maryland State Department of Education data revealed. In total, only 7% of students in the school district tested proficient in math.
High school graduation rates reached a nine-year low in 2022 - a trend that remained evident prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an analysis by Project Baltimore.
OSI's education and youth development director spoke at a Baltimore City Council Education and Youth Committee hearing in 2020, where she touted their study showing a 44% decrease in suspension rates. The committee was chaired at the time by Councilman Zeke Cohen, who previously consulted for Open Society Foundations and now serves as the president of the Baltimore City Council.
Baltimore City Public Schools cited the OSI study on decreased suspension rates and an improved school climate, which it attributed to restorative practices adopted starting in 2018.
One of OSI's final projects before closing its Baltimore office in 2023 was to boost the city's fiscal sponsorship network, as previously reported by Spotlight on Maryland. The system allows larger non-profits to conduct the finances of smaller nonprofits, which allows them to conceal financial information on tax forms.
OSI issued a study with the Annie E. Casey Foundation in 2021 that advocated for government programs to provide more funding for fiscal sponsors.
Tax experts told Spotlight on Maryland that partnerships between government entities and fiscal sponsors enable a system that hides how taxpayer dollars are spent.
Open Society Foundations has given significant funds to two of Baltimore's most prominent fiscal sponsors: roughly $8 million to Fusion Partnerships and roughly $7 million to the Fund For Educational Excellence since 2016.
Hana Pugh, the wife of Mayor Scott, works as the operations director for a fiscal sponsor called Bmore Empowered. The group received $390,000 from the Alliance for Open Society International since 2021.
OSI announced a commitment to spend $20 million in Baltimore as a part of the transition of its office closure in 2023. This includes $10 million toward its "legacy projects," including the Maryland Black Futures Fund, which aims to "ensure that Black power-building and movement-based organizations in Baltimore and across the state of Maryland have the sustained investments and resources they need in their fight to eradicate systemic and institutionalized racism."
Besides Council President Cohen, other Baltimore lawmakers are also tied to Open Society Foundations. Danielle Torain served on Mayor Scott's transition steering committee in 2021 while working as the director of OSI. Alicia Wilson served on Scott's transition team while working as a member of OSI's advisory board. Brittany Young, another member of the mayor's transition team, was an OSI fellow.
Open Society Foundations referred questions from Spotlight on Maryland about Soros's activism in Baltimore to its press release on OSI's closure.
