Homicide: Life on the Street first captivated audiences in 1993, becoming an instant hit with its gritty portrayal of Baltimore detectives investigating brutal murders.
Over 122 episodes, the show ran until 1999, earning its place as one of the all-time great police dramas. Boasting a talented cast, including the late Andre Braugher, Richard Belzer, and Melissa Leo, the series was adapted from David Simon's book Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, which later inspired The Wire.
 Created by Paul Attanasio, the show featured an impressive array of guest stars, such as Chris Rock, Robin Williams, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Marcia Gay Harden. 
 Now, following a major deal with Fremantle, Sky has announced that all seven seasons of Homicide: Life on the Street will be available exclusively on Sky and NOW, reports Surrey Live. 
Remastered in HD and UHD, the classic series will be available to stream from February 14. Expressing enthusiasm for the show's UK release, Jamie Morris, Sky's Executive Director of Content Strategy and Performance, had nothing but excitement.
They stated: "We're delighted that this iconic series is coming to the UK and Ireland and cannot wait for our customers to experience all seven series."
"Homicide: Life on the Street set the bar for some of the greatest series of all-time, many of which you can watch on Sky and NOW alongside this legendary drama which has been lovingly restored."
The show's return has generated immense excitement online, with Reddit users heaping praise on Homicide: Life on the Street. One user, who caught up with the show after its initial run, gushed: "I was and still am completely blown away by this series. 
"Superb characterization, great acting and plots, and I loved the documentary-style filming, i.e. the hand-held camera; very innovative and edgy for the time period."
"I know a lot of TV crime drama fans may disagree with me about this, but after seeing this a second time around -I find this series the best TV crime drama of all time, hands down. The series was very innovative, even by today's standards."
Another fan raved: "This is one of those rare shows that starts off strong and kept up the momentum throughout the series."
 On Twitter, a fan tweeted: "Pleased to see Homicide: Life on the Street finally come back to UK TV. Starts on Sky Atlantic from 14th Feb."
