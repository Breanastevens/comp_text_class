Baltimore, Maryland After a six-day trial, a federal jury found Brandon Russell, 29, a resident of Orlando, Florida, guilty of conspiracy to damage an energy facility.Erek L. Barron, United States Attorney for the District of Maryland and Special Agent in Charge William J. DelBagno, of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Baltimore Field Office announced the jurys verdict.Hate-fueled violence has no place in a civilized society. Brandon Russell went well beyond his First Amendment rights, orchestrating a terrorist plot that would have harmed thousands of innocent people, Barron said. It wont always be popular, but this office will do the right thing, the right way, for the right reason. Brandon Russell, a self-proclaimed National Socialist, conspired to 'lay waste to the city of Baltimore through violence and destruction of critical infrastructure. 
Today's verdict reinforces there is no tolerance for those who seek to harm our communities and use violence to further hate-filled beliefs, DelBagno said. "I am proud of the tremendous work by the FBI Tampa and Baltimore Joint Terrorism Task Forces which led this investigation. The FBI remains diligent in protecting Marylanders from national security and public safety threats every single day in conjunction with our dedicated law enforcement and private sector partners.According to evidence presented at trial, from at least November 2022 to February 3, 2023, Russell conspired to carry out attacks against critical infrastructure, specifically transformers located within electrical substations, in furtherance of Russells racially or ethnically motivated violent extremist beliefs. Russell posted links to open-source maps of infrastructure, which included the locations of electrical substations, and he described how a small number of attacks on substations could cause a cascading failure. Russell also discussed maximizing the impact of the planned attack by hitting multiple substations at one time.Russell recruited a Maryland-based woman, Sarah Beth Clendaniel, to carry out the attacks in Baltimore and elsewhere. They planned to damage energy facilities involved in the transmission and distribution of electricity and to cause a significant interruption and impairment of the Baltimore regional power grid. The intended monetary loss associated with the planned attacks would have exceeded $75 million. Clendaniel identified five substations to target, and Russell attempted to secure a weapon for Clendaniel. Clendaniel stated that if they hit a number of substations all in the same day, they would completely destroy this whole city, and that a good four or five shots through the center of them . . . should make that happen. She further added, [i]t would probably permanently completely lay this city to waste if we could do that successfully.Russell faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for conspiracy to damage an energy facility. Senior United States District Judge James K. Bredar will determine the sentence after accounting for the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar has scheduled sentencing for June 17, 2025 at 11 a.m. On September 25, 2024, U.S. District Judge Bredar sentenced Clendaniel, to 18 years in federal prison, followed by a lifetime of supervised release, for conspiring with Russell to damage or destroy an energy facility in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1366(a), and a concurrent sentence of 15 years for being a felon in possession of a firearm, and 3 years of supervised release, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(g)(1).U.S. Attorney Barron commended the Baltimore and Tampa FBI Field Offices for their outstanding work in the investigation and praised the FBIs Joint Terrorism Task Forces, the Maryland State Police, the Baltimore County Police Department, the Washington and New York Field Offices of the FBI for their valuable assistance. Mr. Barron also thanked the Department of Justices National Security Division and the United States Attorneys Office for the Middle District of Florida for their assistance. Mr. Barron thanked the prosecution team for their hard work and diligence in the case.For more information about the Maryland U.S. Attorneys Office, its priorities, and resources available to help the community, please visit and.
