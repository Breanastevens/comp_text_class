The peaceful transfer of power, a hallmark of American democracy, feels anything but peaceful this time around. Tensions are high, rhetoric is sharp, and Baltimore, like many urban centers across the country, sits squarely in the crosshairs of a political showdown. At the heart of this conflict lies the issue of immigration enforcement, and how cities like Baltimore choose to navigate federal mandates could have lasting consequences - not just politically, but for the safety and well-being of our residents. President-elect Donald Trump's advisers have made their intentions clear that cities and states that refuse to assist in mass deportation efforts risk losing federal funding. Tom Homan, Trump's pick for ""border czar,"" recently said on Fox News that jurisdictions refusing to comply with federal immigration enforcement could see significant financial repercussions. Baltimore, under the leadership of Mayor Brandon Scott and Police Commissioner Richard Worley, has taken a defiant stance, vowing not to allow city law enforcement resources to be diverted toward immigration enforcement. Similarly, Howard County Executive Calvin Ball has echoed this sentiment, citing the county's 2020 Liberty Act, which prohibits local law enforcement from honoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers, regardless of the severity of the crime committed.","The Baltimore Sun","Newspaper",NA,NA,NA,NA

But what's driving down the data remains in question. The city recorded the lowest homicide rate in a decade, and the fewest people killed since 2011. The progress comes on the heels of 261 homicides in 2023, which was the first time the city had dipped below 300 in eight years. Mayor Brandon Scott has touted the work of his comprehensive crime plan, including programs like the Group Violence Reduction Strategy, or GVRS; the program is a collaborative effort between the Mayor's Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement, MONSE, along with the Baltimore Police Department, and the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office. Through GVRS, people involved in a violent lifestyle are offered paths to a different life, but if they refuse, law enforcement gets involved.","The Baltimore Sun","Newspaper",NA,NA,NA,NA

The city received a total of $641 million through the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021, signed into law by President Joe Biden to address the COVID-19 pandemic and economic instability caused by government shutdowns. Local jurisdictions were given wide leeway on how to spend the funds, including to address problems like crime. Baltimore allocated a similar amount of funds to public safety as other cities, but there was a key difference: In contrast with other cities, Baltimore devoted a far greater portion of its spending to violence reduction and prevention efforts than it did to police.","The Baltimore Sun","Newspaper",NA,NA,NA,NA

Baltimore Circuit Judge Shannon E. Avery rejected a request from Hanover Armory's attorneys to resolve the lawsuit in its favor without a trial, ruling that Baltimore's lawyers would get to present their case to a jury. The trial is scheduled for December. Surviving this legal hurdle represents another victory for Baltimore in its litigation related to the untraceable, finish-building-at-home guns that officials say have flooded city streets. In February, the city settled for $1.2 million with Polymer80 Inc., the nation's largest manufacturer of so-called ghost guns.

Experts say most cities are seeing a drop in crime levels that spiked during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. But they say misleading campaign rhetoric in the runup to the November election and changes in how people interpret news about crime have led to a perception gap.","Wisconsin State Journal (Madison, Wisconsin)","Newspaper",NA,NA,NA,NA
